Full moon days are also very significant to performSatya Narayana Puja.\n\nPhalguna Purnima, which is the last Purnima of the year, is no exception. Holithe one of the most significant and popular Hindu festivals is observed during Phalguna Purnima. The day also coincides withLakshmi Jayanti, the birth anniversary of Hindu Goddess of wealth and prosperity.\n\nPhalguna Purnima is also known asVasanta Purnima, as this Purnima coincides with Vasanta Ritu out of totalsix Ritu(s) or seasons in Vedic astrology. It is important to note that Hindu festivals are not linked with seasons as all Hindu festivals drift away from seasons due to precession. As it takes thousands of years to notice seasonal change of Hindu festivals, it is assumed that festivals are linked to seasons and festivals are given alternate names based on the season they currently coincide with.\n\nIn South Indian states, namely Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka, Phalguna Purnima is observed asKama Dahanam. The rituals of Kama Dahanam are same that ofHolika Dahanbut the legend associated with Kama Dahanam is different thanlegend of Holika Dahan. Generally Holi is considered as North Indian festival but it is also observed asKaman Pandigaiin Tamil Nadu andKamuni Pandugain Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.\n\nIn West Bengal and Orissa, Dol Purnimais observed during Phalguna Purnima. The festival of Dol Purnima is dedicated toLord Krishna. On this day, the procession of Lord Krishna is taken through streets while devotees playing Holi with Lord Krishna.\n\nPhalguna Purnima also coincides with the birth anniversary ofChaitanya Mahaprabhu. Hence the day of Phalguna Purnima is very significant for Gaudiya Vaishnava(s)."

After the final offering of coconuts, flowers and sweets, the statues of Lord Ganesha are taken to the water body through the street procession with much fanfare. Thousands of devotees join the procession and fill the whole atmosphere with chanting of Lord Ganesha. \"Ganapati Bappa Morya\" and \"Ganesh Maharaj Ki, Jai\" are few of the famous slogans which are chanted throughout the procession.\n\nIn Mumbai, Ganesha Visarjan is performed under the guidance of Ganpati Mandals. The street procession is accompanied with Dhol, Tasha and the other traditional instruments. Ganesha Visarjan continues throughout the night till the next morning.\n\nFew families perform Ganesha Visarjan on the 3rd, 5th or 7th day rather performing it on the 11th day as per their family tradition. The idol of Lord Ganesha can be immersed in the water of tub or bucket."

Hence, one name of this fast is also Kaumudi Vrat. According to Skandapuran, Kojagara Vrat is the best fast, by observing which even an ordinary being attains the highest position and gets opulence, health and children in this birth and in other births also.\n\nThe day when Purnima is Nishithvyapini, that day is considered best for Kojagara puja.\n\nKojagara Puja Purnima is more famously known asSharad Purnimain most parts of India. However, most people in Indiaworship Goddess Lakshmion Amavasya Tithi duringDiwali.\n\nKojagara Puja Mahatamya is described by Valakhilya Rishi -\n\nThe disciples of sage Valakhilya asked, describe the Upangvratas of Kartik, by observing which fast of Kartika gets completed. Valakhilya said that, on the Shuklapaksha Purnima of Ashwin month, one should worship Lakshmi Ji with devotion at night. On this day, Goddess Lakshmi is pleased by drinkingcoconut waterand playing the game ofChausar. On the night of Kojagara Puja, Goddess Lakshmi comes to visit the earth to give boons to the devotees who are doing Jagrana. All the devotees who are surrounded by poverty must observe this fast because a poor Brahmin named Valit also became very rich by observing this fast.\n\nThe sages asked, who was Valit and where did he get the money from? Please describe this story in detail.\n\nA Brahmin named Valit lived in the country of Magadha. Although he was rich in much knowledge and used to perform Sandhya Snana daily, but financially he was very poor. If someone came to donate something to him at home, he would accept it, otherwise he would not go to ask for anything from anyone.\n\nTo read in detail, please click onKojagara Vrat Katha."

It is believed that Sharad Purnima is the only day in the year when the moon comes out with all sixteen Kala(s). In Hinduism, each human quality is associated with certain Kala and it is believed that the combination of sixteen different Kala(s) creates a perfect human personality. It wasLord Krishnawho was born with all sixteen Kala(s) and He was the complete incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Lord Ramawas born with only twelve Kala(s).\n\nHence, worshipping God Chandra on the day of Sharad Purnima is considered very significant. Newly wed women, who take pledge to doPurnimasi fastingfor the year, begin the fast from the day of Sharad Purnima. In Gujarat Sharad Purnima is more popularly known asSharad Poonam.\n\nOn this day not only Moon shines with all sixteen Kala(s) but also its rays have certain healing properties which nourish the body and the soul. It is also believed that the moon rays on the day of Sharad Purnima drip nectar. Hence to take advantage of this divine phenomenon, traditionally on the day of Sharad Purnima, Rice-Kheer a famous Indian sweet dish made of cow milk, rice and sugar, is prepared and left in moonlight for the whole night. In the morning, Rice-Kheer which is believed to be invigorated and fortified with the moonlight is consumed and distributed as Prasad in family members.\n\nIn Brij region, Sharad Purnima is also known asRaas Purnima(रास पूर्णिमा). It is believed that on the day of Sharad Purnima Lord Krishna performed Maha-Raas, the dance of divine love. On the night of Sharad Purnima, upon hearing the divine music of Krishna's flute, Gopis of Vrindavan sneaked away from their homes and families to the forest to dance with Krishna throughout the night. It was the day when Lord Krishna created several of Krishna(s) to accompany each Gopi. It is believed that Lord Krishna supernaturally stretched the night to the length of one night of Lord Brahma which was equivalent of billions of human years.\n\nIn many regions Sharad Purnima is known asKojagara Purnimawhen Kojagara Vrat is observed for the whole day. Kojagara Vrat is also known asKaumudi Vrat(कौमुदी व्रत)."

Depending on people and the region, the full moon day in Hindu calendar is also referred as Poornima, Poonam, Pournami and Pournimasi. In Vaishnava tradition Kartik month is known as Damodara month. Damodara is one of the names ofLord Krishna.\n\nIn Hindu calendar, Kartik is the holiest month among all lunar months. Many people take pledge to take holy dip before sunrise in Ganges and other holy rivers every day during the month of Kartik. The ritual of holy dip during Kartik month begins on the day ofSharad Purnimaand ends on Kartik Purnima.\n\nKartik Purnima is also very significant as many rituals and festivals culminate on the day of Kartik Purnima. The festivities of Kartika Purnima begin on the day ofPrabodhini Ekadashi. Ekadashi is the eleventh day and Purnima is the fifteenth day of Kartika month during Shukla Paksha. Hence Kartik Purnima festivities last for five days.\n\nTulasi-Vivah Utsavwhich begins on the day of Prabodhini Ekadashi culminates on the day of Kartik Purnima. As per religious books, Tulasi Vivahcan be performed on any suitable day between Ekadashi to Purnima in the month of Kartik. However, many people choose the day of Kartik Purnima to perform marriage rituals ofGoddess TulasiandLord Shaligram, an iconic representation of Lord Vishnu.\n\nBhishma Panchakafasting which begins on Ekadashi day ends on the day of Kartik Purnima. In Vaishnava tradition, the utmost importance is given to Bhishma Panchaka fasting during the last five days of Kartik month. The five days fasting is known as Bhishma Panchaka as well asVishnu Panchaka.\n\nVaikuntha Chaturdashifasting and Puja is performed on Chaturdashi Tithi i. E. One day before Kartik Purnima. It is believed that Lord Vishnu worshipped Lord Shiva on the day of Kartik Chaturdashi during Shukla Paksha and offered Him one thousand lotus flowers. Many Shiva temples organize special Puja during which Lord Vishnu is worshipped along with Lord Shiva. On the day of Vaikuntha Chaturdashi, a holy dip in Ganges before Sunrise at Manikarnika Ghat in Varanasi is considered very significant among devotees of Lord Shiva.\n\nDev Diwaliwhich is also known as Diwali of Gods is celebrated on the day of Kartik Purnima. It is believed thatLord Shivakilled demonTripurasuraon the day of Kartik Purnima. Hence Kartik Purnima is also known as Tripuri Purnima andTripurari Purnima. As per legends of Tripuri Purnima, Tripurasura defeated Gods and started ruling their kingdom. When Tripurasura was killed, Gods were overjoyed and celebrated the day of Kartik Purnima as the day of illuminations. Hence thousands of earthen lamps are lit at all temples as well as at the bank of river Ganga on the day of Kartik Purnima."

If Bhadra prevails during Pradosh but it ends before midnight then Holika Dahan should be done after Bhadra is over. If Bhadra is getting over after midnight then only Holika Dahan should be done in Bhadra and preferably duringBhadra Punchha. However one should avoid Bhadra Mukha and in no condition Holika Dahan should be done inBhadra Mukha. Doing so brings bad luck for the whole year not only for individuals but for whole city and country. Many times Bhadra Punchha is not available between Pradosh and midnight. In such situations one should do Holika Dahan during Pradosh. In rare occasions when neither Pradosh nor Bhadra Punchha is available then one should do Holika Dahan after Pradosh.\n\nChoosing right Muhurta for Holika Dahan is more important than choosing right Muhurta for any other festivals.

It is important to note that Hindu festivals are not linked with seasons as all Hindu festivals drift away from seasons due to precession. As it takes thousands of years to notice seasonal change of Hindu festivals, it is assumed that festivals are linked to seasons and festivals are given alternate names based on the season they currently coincide with.\n\nIn South Indian states, namely Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka, Phalguna Purnima is observed asKama Dahanam. The rituals of Kama Dahanam are same that ofHolika Dahanbut the legend associated with Kama Dahanam is different thanlegend of Holika Dahan. Generally Holi is considered as North Indian festival but it is also observed asKaman Pandigaiin Tamil Nadu andKamuni Pandugain Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.\n\nIn West Bengal and Orissa, Dol Purnimais observed during Phalguna Purnima. The festival of Dol Purnima is dedicated toLord Krishna. On this day, the procession of Lord Krishna is taken through streets while devotees playing Holi with Lord Krishna.\n\nPhalguna Purnima also coincides with the birth anniversary ofChaitanya Mahaprabhu.

They should offer flowers and sweet water at the root of the Vata Vriksha and tie a raw cotton thread around it while doing Parikrama. After the ritual, they should seek blessings from the elders in the family. The adornment items used for the ritual should be given to an elderly married woman. People who follow the general Purnima fast can also worship Lord Vishnu and Goddess Lakshmi under the Vat tree and chant Mantras.\n\nThis is a special type of fast, and following it properly is believed to fulfill all desires. It is described in theSkanda Purana. When the Jyeshtha Purnima falls on aTuesday, this fast is started. On that day, take a bath in the morning using mustard-mixed water, and worship theBilva Vriksha, i. E., Bael tree with Gandha and Pushpa etc. Eat only once during the day. If the food is seen by a dog, pig, or donkey, it should be discarded immediately. In this way, observe a fast on all full moon days for the next one year.

The day of Kali Chaudas is decided when Chaturdashi prevails during midnight which as per Panchang is known as Maha Nishita time.\n\nAs rituals of Kali Chaudas involve visiting crematorium during midnight for offering Puja to the Goddess of darkness and toVeer Vetal, the day of Kali Chaudas is decided when Chaturdashi prevails during midnight.\n\nIt seems that most Panchang do not make such distinction and list Kali Chaudas with Roop Chaudas and Narak Chaturdashi. Hence one has to be cautious while looking for Kali Chaudas date.\n\nFurther Kali Chaudas should not be confused with BengalKali Pujawhich is observed one day after Kali Chaudas when Amavasya Tithi prevails during midnight."

Hence for Chaturvedi community Diwali rituals continue till Dashami Tithi and beyond that.\n\nNext day of Kansa Vadh coincides withDev Uthan Ekadashiday.

Depending on people and the region, the full moon day in Hindu calendar is also referred as Poornima, Poonam, Pournami and Pournimasi. In Vaishnava tradition Kartik month is known as Damodara month. Damodara is one of the names ofLord Krishna.\n\nIn Hindu calendar, Kartik is the holiest month among all lunar months. Many people take pledge to take holy dip before sunrise in Ganges and other holy rivers every day during the month of Kartik. The ritual of holy dip during Kartik month begins on the day ofSharad Purnimaand ends on Kartik Purnima.\n\nKartik Purnima is also very significant as many rituals and festivals culminate on the day of Kartik Purnima. The festivities of Kartika Purnima begin on the day ofPrabodhini Ekadashi. Ekadashi is the eleventh day and Purnima is the fifteenth day of Kartika month during Shukla Paksha. Hence Kartik Purnima festivities last for five days.\n\nTulasi-Vivah Utsavwhich begins on the day of Prabodhini Ekadashi culminates on the day of Kartik Purnima. As per religious books, Tulasi Vivahcan be performed on any suitable day between Ekadashi to Purnima in the month of Kartik. However, many people choose the day of Kartik Purnima to perform marriage rituals ofGoddess TulasiandLord Shaligram, an iconic representation of Lord Vishnu.\n\nBhishma Panchakafasting which begins on Ekadashi day ends on the day of Kartik Purnima. In Vaishnava tradition, the utmost importance is given to Bhishma Panchaka fasting during the last five days of Kartik month. The five days fasting is known as Bhishma Panchaka as well asVishnu Panchaka.\n\nVaikuntha Chaturdashifasting and Puja is performed on Chaturdashi Tithi i. E. One day before Kartik Purnima. It is believed that Lord Vishnu worshipped Lord Shiva on the day of Kartik Chaturdashi during Shukla Paksha and offered Him one thousand lotus flowers. Many Shiva temples organize special Puja during which Lord Vishnu is worshipped along with Lord Shiva. On the day of Vaikuntha Chaturdashi, a holy dip in Ganges before Sunrise at Manikarnika Ghat in Varanasi is considered very significant among devotees of Lord Shiva.\n\nDev Diwaliwhich is also known as Diwali of Gods is celebrated on the day of Kartik Purnima. It is believed thatLord Shivakilled demonTripurasuraon the day of Kartik Purnima. Hence Kartik Purnima is also known as Tripuri Purnima andTripurari Purnima. As per legends of Tripuri Purnima, Tripurasura defeated Gods and started ruling their kingdom. When Tripurasura was killed, Gods were overjoyed and celebrated the day of Kartik Purnima as the day of illuminations. Hence thousands of earthen lamps are lit at all temples as well as at the bank of river Ganga on the day of Kartik Purnima."

All Ekadashi fasting are dedicated toGoddess Ekadashiwho is one of the Shaktis of Lord Vishnu. Ekadashi was born out of Lord Vishnu to annihilate Demon Mur who intended to kill sleeping Lord Vishnu. Hence Goddess Ekadashi is one of the protective powers of Lord Vishnu.

The Purnima Tithi of Jyeshtha month is also known asVat Purnima. In many regions of India, married women observe a fast on Vat Purnima for the long life of their husbands. Besides this, the day is also considered very auspicious for offering Tarpan and Dana, i. E., donations in memory of ancestors. The day also holds special importance for worshippingLord VishnuandGoddess Lakshmi.\n\nJust like the Vat Savitri Vrat, women can observe a fast on the full moon day for good fortune and the growth of the family. Married women should take a vow for the fast, get fully adorned, and worship theVata Vriksha, i. E., banyan tree. They should offer flowers and sweet water at the root of the Vata Vriksha and tie a raw cotton thread around it while doing Parikrama. After the ritual, they should seek blessings from the elders in the family. The adornment items used for the ritual should be given to an elderly married woman. People who follow the general Purnima fast can also worship Lord Vishnu and Goddess Lakshmi under the Vat tree and chant Mantras.\n\nThis is a special type of fast, and following it properly is believed to fulfill all desires. It is described in theSkanda Purana. When the Jyeshtha Purnima falls on aTuesday, this fast is started. On that day, take a bath in the morning using mustard-mixed water, and worship theBilva Vriksha, i. E., Bael tree with Gandha and Pushpa etc. Eat only once during the day. If the food is seen by a dog, pig, or donkey, it should be discarded immediately. In this way, observe a fast on all full moon days for the next one year. On the final day of the fast, go near the Bilva tree and fill a container with aprroximatley 1 kg of grains such as barley, wheat, rice, and sesame. Cover another container with two pieces of cloth and install a gold idol ofUma-Maheshwarain it. Offer two red clothes, various Gandha, Pushpa, Dhupa, Dipa, and Naivedya, etc. During worship.\n\nShriniketa Namastubhyam Hara Priya Namoastu Te।Avaidhavyam Cha Me Dehi Shriyam Janmani Janmani॥\n\nPray by chanting this Mantra then offer 1, 000 Ahuti(s) using Bilva leaves, and provide clothes, ornaments, and food to four, eight, or sixteen married couples.

This day is known asBahuda (बहुदा) YatraorReturn Yatraand is observed on the eighth day after Ratha Yatra on Dashami Tithi (if we do not have any skipped or leaped Tithi during Lords' stay in Gundicha temple). During Bahuda Yatra Lord makes a short stoppage atMausi Maa templewhich is dedicated toGoddess Ardhashini.\n\nIt should be noted that Lord Jagannatha returns to his main abode just beforeDevshayani Ekadashiwhen Lord Jagannatha goes to sleep for four months. Ratha Yatra is also known asPuri Car Festivalamong foreign visitors.\n\nIt should be noted that rituals of Ratha Yatra start much ahead of Ratha Yatra day. Approximately 18 days before of Ratha Yatra Lord Jagannatha, his brother Balabhadra and his sister Devi Subhadra are given famous ceremonial bath which is known asSnana Yatra. Snana Yatra day is observed on Purnima Tithi in Jyeshtha month which is popularly known asJyestha Purnima."

This astronomical event occurs annually at the end of the month of Shravana or the beginning of Bhadrapada. The literal meaning of the word Sankranti is \"transition\" or \"change of position\". In some regions, Simha Sankranti is also referred to asSinghudi SankrantiorSinghada Parva. The period during which the Surya moves from one Rashi to another is called Sankranti. Simha Sankranti marks the occasion of the Surya entering the Simha Rashi and is considered highly auspicious for religious activities such as performing rituals, charity, penance, holy bathing and offerings Pitru Tarpan.\n\nAccording to Vedic astrology, the ruler of Simha Rashi is the Lord Surya. Hence, when the Surya enters Simha Rashi, it is said to be in its own house, i. E., Swagruhi, which amplifies its brilliance, influence and auspiciousness. For this reason, Simha Sankranti is considered a special time for Pitru Aradhana, performing charitable deeds, conducting Shraddha rituals, and offering prayers to the Lord Surya.\n\nGrihya Sutras, Dharma Shastras and various Puranas describe Sankranti periods as especially meritorious times. Notably, texts such as theNarada Purana, Matsya Purana, Skanda PuranaandVishnu Dharmasutrastate that religious acts performed during the Sankranti period yield a thousand times more merit compared to those performed at other times. Simha Sankranti is particularly significant for ancestral rituals. Any Shraddha, Tarpan, or Pind Daan performed during this time is believed to deeply satisfy the ancestors and bring prosperity to the lineage.\n\nOn this day, one should bathe early in the morning using water mixed with Ganga water and offer Arghya to the Lord Surya. After that, Tarpan should be performed for ancestors using sesame seeds and water, then offer food with Dakshina to a Brahmin. As per scriptures, anyone who donates food, clothing, umbrellas, footwear, cows, gold or land, etc., during Sankranti with devotion and within their means, earns merit for seven lifetimes.\n\nSimha Sankranti represents the inner strength and radiance of Lord Surya. As the Lord Surya enters its own sign Simha, it becomes a symbol of spiritual energy, penance, wisdom, brilliance, and courage. Therefore, this period is especially beneficial for spiritual seekers. Various Upanishads and Yogic texts mention that Surya worship, Gayatri Mantrachanting and Pranayama performed during Sankranti lead to spiritual accomplishment.\n\nThus, Simha Sankranti is not merely an astronomical event but a significant religious festival. Those who observe fasts, do chanting, take holy baths, offer Tarpan and engage in charity on this day with devotion are blessed both materially and spiritually."

On this day, Goddess Lakshmi is pleased by drinkingcoconut waterand playing the game ofChausar. On the night of Kojagara Puja, Goddess Lakshmi comes to visit the earth to give boons to the devotees who are doing Jagrana. All the devotees who are surrounded by poverty must observe this fast because a poor Brahmin named Valit also became very rich by observing this fast.\n\nThe sages asked, who was Valit and where did he get the money from? Please describe this story in detail.\n\nA Brahmin named Valit lived in the country of Magadha. Although he was rich in much knowledge and used to perform Sandhya Snana daily, but financially he was very poor. If someone came to donate something to him at home, he would accept it, otherwise he would not go to ask for anything from anyone.\n\nTo read in detail, please click onKojagara Vrat Katha."

It wasLord Krishnawho was born with all sixteen Kala(s) and He was the complete incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Lord Ramawas born with only twelve Kala(s).\n\nHence, worshipping God Chandra on the day of Sharad Purnima is considered very significant. Newly wed women, who take pledge to doPurnimasi fastingfor the year, begin the fast from the day of Sharad Purnima. In Gujarat Sharad Purnima is more popularly known asSharad Poonam.\n\nOn this day not only Moon shines with all sixteen Kala(s) but also its rays have certain healing properties which nourish the body and the soul. It is also believed that the moon rays on the day of Sharad Purnima drip nectar. Hence to take advantage of this divine phenomenon, traditionally on the day of Sharad Purnima, Rice-Kheer a famous Indian sweet dish made of cow milk, rice and sugar, is prepared and left in moonlight for the whole night. In the morning, Rice-Kheer which is believed to be invigorated and fortified with the moonlight is consumed and distributed as Prasad in family members.\n\nIn Brij region, Sharad Purnima is also known asRaas Purnima(रास पूर्णिमा). It is believed that on the day of Sharad Purnima Lord Krishna performed Maha-Raas, the dance of divine love. On the night of Sharad Purnima, upon hearing the divine music of Krishna's flute, Gopis of Vrindavan sneaked away from their homes and families to the forest to dance with Krishna throughout the night. It was the day when Lord Krishna created several of Krishna(s) to accompany each Gopi. It is believed that Lord Krishna supernaturally stretched the night to the length of one night of Lord Brahma which was equivalent of billions of human years.\n\nIn many regions Sharad Purnima is known asKojagara Purnimawhen Kojagara Vrat is observed for the whole day. Kojagara Vrat is also known asKaumudi Vrat(कौमुदी व्रत)."

Depending on people and the region, the full moon day in Hindu calendar is also referred as Poornima, Poonam, Pournami and Pournimasi. In Vaishnava tradition Kartik month is known as Damodara month. Damodara is one of the names ofLord Krishna.\n\nIn Hindu calendar, Kartik is the holiest month among all lunar months. Many people take pledge to take holy dip before sunrise in Ganges and other holy rivers every day during the month of Kartik. The ritual of holy dip during Kartik month begins on the day ofSharad Purnimaand ends on Kartik Purnima.\n\nKartik Purnima is also very significant as many rituals and festivals culminate on the day of Kartik Purnima. The festivities of Kartika Purnima begin on the day ofPrabodhini Ekadashi. Ekadashi is the eleventh day and Purnima is the fifteenth day of Kartika month during Shukla Paksha. Hence Kartik Purnima festivities last for five days.\n\nTulasi-Vivah Utsavwhich begins on the day of Prabodhini Ekadashi culminates on the day of Kartik Purnima. As per religious books, Tulasi Vivahcan be performed on any suitable day between Ekadashi to Purnima in the month of Kartik. However, many people choose the day of Kartik Purnima to perform marriage rituals ofGoddess TulasiandLord Shaligram, an iconic representation of Lord Vishnu.\n\nBhishma Panchakafasting which begins on Ekadashi day ends on the day of Kartik Purnima. In Vaishnava tradition, the utmost importance is given to Bhishma Panchaka fasting during the last five days of Kartik month. The five days fasting is known as Bhishma Panchaka as well asVishnu Panchaka.\n\nVaikuntha Chaturdashifasting and Puja is performed on Chaturdashi Tithi i. E. One day before Kartik Purnima. It is believed that Lord Vishnu worshipped Lord Shiva on the day of Kartik Chaturdashi during Shukla Paksha and offered Him one thousand lotus flowers. Many Shiva temples organize special Puja during which Lord Vishnu is worshipped along with Lord Shiva. On the day of Vaikuntha Chaturdashi, a holy dip in Ganges before Sunrise at Manikarnika Ghat in Varanasi is considered very significant among devotees of Lord Shiva.\n\nDev Diwaliwhich is also known as Diwali of Gods is celebrated on the day of Kartik Purnima. It is believed thatLord Shivakilled demonTripurasuraon the day of Kartik Purnima. Hence Kartik Purnima is also known as Tripuri Purnima andTripurari Purnima. As per legends of Tripuri Purnima, Tripurasura defeated Gods and started ruling their kingdom. When Tripurasura was killed, Gods were overjoyed and celebrated the day of Kartik Purnima as the day of illuminations. Hence thousands of earthen lamps are lit at all temples as well as at the bank of river Ganga on the day of Kartik Purnima."

All Ekadashi fasting are dedicated toGoddess Ekadashiwho is one of the Shaktis of Lord Vishnu. Ekadashi was born out of Lord Vishnu to annihilate Demon Mur who intended to kill sleeping Lord Vishnu. Hence Goddess Ekadashi is one of the protective powers of Lord Vishnu.

It marks the beginning of nine days festivity. Our scriptures have well defined rules and guidelines to perform Ghatasthapana during a certain period of time at the beginning of Navratri. Ghatasthapana is invocation ofGoddess Shaktiand doing it wrong time, as our scriptures forewarn, might bring wrath of the Goddess Shakti. Ghatasthapana is prohibited during Amavasya and night time.\n\nThe most auspicious or Shubh time to do Ghatasthapana is first one third of the day while Pratipada is prevailing. If due to some reasons this time is not available then Ghatasthapana can be done duringAbhijit Muhurta. It is advised to avoidNakshatra ChitraandVaidhriti Yogaduring Ghatasthapana but those are not prohibited. The most important factor to consider is that Ghatasthapana is done before Hindu midday while Pratipada is prevailing.\n\nDrikPanchang.

In other words we don't use Muhurta calculated for one city for any other city to make sure we consider all local factors like sunrise, sunset, midday, ascendant and last but not the least DST, if applicable.\n\nYou will find many sources which advise to takeChoghadiya Muhurtato do Ghatasthapana but our scriptures don't advise to take Choghadiya Muhurta. DrikPanchang. Comteam researches all authentic sources and follows only those rules which are well documented inVedicscriptures. However if you want to choose Choghadiya Muhurta you can take it fromChoghadiyapage but we don't recommend it to use for Ghatasthapana.\n\nWe also considerLagnaand try to includeDvi-Svabhava Lagna (द्वि स्वभाव लग्न)into calculated Muhurta. During Shardiya Navratri Dvi-Svabhava LagnaKanyaprevails during sunrise and if suitable we take it for Ghatasthapana Muhurta.\n\nThe factors which are prohibited for Ghatasthapana are afternoon, night time and any time beyond sixteen Ghatis after sunrise.\n\nGhatasthapana is also known asKalash SthapanaorKalashsthapana.

They should offer flowers and sweet water at the root of the Vata Vriksha and tie a raw cotton thread around it while doing Parikrama. After the ritual, they should seek blessings from the elders in the family. The adornment items used for the ritual should be given to an elderly married woman. People who follow the general Purnima fast can also worship Lord Vishnu and Goddess Lakshmi under the Vat tree and chant Mantras.\n\nThis is a special type of fast, and following it properly is believed to fulfill all desires. It is described in theSkanda Purana. When the Jyeshtha Purnima falls on aTuesday, this fast is started.

Lord Jagannatha is considered a form of Lord Vishnu and also revered by the followers of Vaishnavism. Jagannatha literally means Lord of the Universe. Jagannatha temple is one of the four Hindu pilgrimage centers known asChar Dhampilgrimages that a Hindu is expected to make in one's lifetime. Lord Jagannatha is worshipped along with his brotherBalabhadraand his sister DeviSubhadra.\n\nRatha Yatra commemorates Lord Jagannatha's annual visit toGundicha (गुंडीचा) Mata temple. It is said that to honor the devotion ofQueen Gundicha, wife of the legendaryKing Indradyumna (इन्द्रद्युम्न)who built the Puri Jagannatha temple, the Lord Jagannatha, Balabhadra and Subhadra leave their regular abode in the main temple and spend a few days in this temple built by Gundicha in their honor.\n\nOne day before of Ratha Yatra, Gundicha Temple is cleaned by devotees of Lord Jagannatha. The ritual of cleaning Gundicha temple is known asGundicha Marjana (मार्जन)and is held one day before Ratha Yatra.\n\nThe fourth day after Ratha Yatra is celebrated asHera Panchami (हेरा पञ्चमी)whenGoddess Lakshmi, the consort of Lord Jagannatha, visits Gundicha temple in search of Lord Jagannatha. Hera Panchami should not be confused with Panchami Tithi as Hera Panchami is celebrated on the fourth day after Ratha Yatra and usually observed on Shashthi Tithi.\n\nAfter resting eight days in Gundicha temple Lord Jagannatha returns to his main abode. This day is known asBahuda (बहुदा) YatraorReturn Yatraand is observed on the eighth day after Ratha Yatra on Dashami Tithi (if we do not have any skipped or leaped Tithi during Lords' stay in Gundicha temple). During Bahuda Yatra Lord makes a short stoppage atMausi Maa templewhich is dedicated toGoddess Ardhashini.\n\nIt should be noted that Lord Jagannatha returns to his main abode just beforeDevshayani Ekadashiwhen Lord Jagannatha goes to sleep for four months. Ratha Yatra is also known asPuri Car Festivalamong foreign visitors.\n\nIt should be noted that rituals of Ratha Yatra start much ahead of Ratha Yatra day. Approximately 18 days before of Ratha Yatra Lord Jagannatha, his brother Balabhadra and his sister Devi Subhadra are given famous ceremonial bath which is known asSnana Yatra. Snana Yatra day is observed on Purnima Tithi in Jyeshtha month which is popularly known asJyestha Purnima."

In the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishnasays - \"Masanam Margashirshoaham\", that is, \"I am Margashirsha among the months. \" This statement of Lord Krishna proves the spiritual importance of the month of Margashirsha.\n\nOn the day of Margashirsha Purnima, there is a tradition of worshippingLord Vishnu, especially HisSatyanarayanaform.

Holithe one of the most significant and popular Hindu festivals is observed during Phalguna Purnima. The day also coincides withLakshmi Jayanti, the birth anniversary of Hindu Goddess of wealth and prosperity.\n\nPhalguna Purnima is also known asVasanta Purnima, as this Purnima coincides with Vasanta Ritu out of totalsix Ritu(s) or seasons in Vedic astrology. It is important to note that Hindu festivals are not linked with seasons as all Hindu festivals drift away from seasons due to precession. As it takes thousands of years to notice seasonal change of Hindu festivals, it is assumed that festivals are linked to seasons and festivals are given alternate names based on the season they currently coincide with.\n\nIn South Indian states, namely Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka, Phalguna Purnima is observed asKama Dahanam. The rituals of Kama Dahanam are same that ofHolika Dahanbut the legend associated with Kama Dahanam is different thanlegend of Holika Dahan. Generally Holi is considered as North Indian festival but it is also observed asKaman Pandigaiin Tamil Nadu andKamuni Pandugain Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.\n\nIn West Bengal and Orissa, Dol Purnimais observed during Phalguna Purnima. The festival of Dol Purnima is dedicated toLord Krishna. On this day, the procession of Lord Krishna is taken through streets while devotees playing Holi with Lord Krishna.\n\nPhalguna Purnima also coincides with the birth anniversary ofChaitanya Mahaprabhu. Hence the day of Phalguna Purnima is very significant for Gaudiya Vaishnava(s)."

      "description": "The month of Jyeshtha is very popular for various festivals and celebrations. In scriptures, the word Jyeshtha literally means 'elder'. Therefore, this month is considered especially important for the eldest child in the family. On the Purnima Tithi of this month, the Chandra travels through the Jyeshtha Nakshatra. The Purnima Tithi of Jyeshtha month is also known asVat Purnima. In many regions of India, married women observe a fast on Vat Purnima for the long life of their husbands. Besides this, the day is also considered very auspicious for offering Tarpan and Dana, i. E., donations in memory of ancestors. The day also holds special importance for worshippingLord VishnuandGoddess Lakshmi.\n\nJust like the Vat Savitri Vrat, women can observe a fast on the full moon day for good fortune and the growth of the family. Married women should take a vow for the fast, get fully adorned, and worship theVata Vriksha, i. E., banyan tree. They should offer flowers and sweet water at the root of the Vata Vriksha and tie a raw cotton thread around it while doing Parikrama. After the ritual, they should seek blessings from the elders in the family. The adornment items used for the ritual should be given to an elderly married woman. People who follow the general Purnima fast can also worship Lord Vishnu and Goddess Lakshmi under the Vat tree and chant Mantras.\n\nThis is a special type of fast, and following it properly is believed to fulfill all desires. It is described in theSkanda Purana. When the Jyeshtha Purnima falls on aTuesday, this fast is started. On that day, take a bath in the morning using mustard-mixed water, and worship theBilva Vriksha, i. E., Bael tree with Gandha and Pushpa etc. Eat only once during the day. If the food is seen by a dog, pig, or donkey, it should be discarded immediately. In this way, observe a fast on all full moon days for the next one year. On the final day of the fast, go near the Bilva tree and fill a container with aprroximatley 1 kg of grains such as barley, wheat, rice, and sesame. Cover another container with two pieces of cloth and install a gold idol ofUma-Maheshwarain it. Offer two red clothes, various Gandha, Pushpa, Dhupa, Dipa, and Naivedya, etc. During worship.\n\nShriniketa Namastubhyam Hara Priya Namoastu Te।Avaidhavyam Cha Me Dehi Shriyam Janmani Janmani॥\n\nPray by chanting this Mantra then offer 1, 000 Ahuti(s) using Bilva leaves, and provide clothes, ornaments, and food to four, eight, or sixteen married couples. This is believed to fulfill all desires."

Currently it falls in month of June or July in Gregorian calendar.\n\nLord Jagannathais worshipped primarily in city of Puri at famous Jagannatha temple. Lord Jagannatha is considered a form of Lord Vishnu and also revered by the followers of Vaishnavism. Jagannatha literally means Lord of the Universe. Jagannatha temple is one of the four Hindu pilgrimage centers known asChar Dhampilgrimages that a Hindu is expected to make in one's lifetime. Lord Jagannatha is worshipped along with his brotherBalabhadraand his sister DeviSubhadra.\n\nRatha Yatra commemorates Lord Jagannatha's annual visit toGundicha (गुंडीचा) Mata temple. It is said that to honor the devotion ofQueen Gundicha, wife of the legendaryKing Indradyumna (इन्द्रद्युम्न)who built the Puri Jagannatha temple, the Lord Jagannatha, Balabhadra and Subhadra leave their regular abode in the main temple and spend a few days in this temple built by Gundicha in their honor.\n\nOne day before of Ratha Yatra, Gundicha Temple is cleaned by devotees of Lord Jagannatha. The ritual of cleaning Gundicha temple is known asGundicha Marjana (मार्जन)and is held one day before Ratha Yatra.\n\nThe fourth day after Ratha Yatra is celebrated asHera Panchami (हेरा पञ्चमी)whenGoddess Lakshmi, the consort of Lord Jagannatha, visits Gundicha temple in search of Lord Jagannatha.

This day is known asBahuda (बहुदा) YatraorReturn Yatraand is observed on the eighth day after Ratha Yatra on Dashami Tithi (if we do not have any skipped or leaped Tithi during Lords' stay in Gundicha temple). During Bahuda Yatra Lord makes a short stoppage atMausi Maa templewhich is dedicated toGoddess Ardhashini.\n\nIt should be noted that Lord Jagannatha returns to his main abode just beforeDevshayani Ekadashiwhen Lord Jagannatha goes to sleep for four months. Ratha Yatra is also known asPuri Car Festivalamong foreign visitors.\n\nIt should be noted that rituals of Ratha Yatra start much ahead of Ratha Yatra day. Approximately 18 days before of Ratha Yatra Lord Jagannatha, his brother Balabhadra and his sister Devi Subhadra are given famous ceremonial bath which is known asSnana Yatra. Snana Yatra day is observed on Purnima Tithi in Jyeshtha month which is popularly known asJyestha Purnima."

      "description": "According to the Hindu Panchang, the time when theLord Suryatransits from theKarka RashitoSimha Rashiis known as Simha Sankranti. This astronomical event occurs annually at the end of the month of Shravana or the beginning of Bhadrapada. The literal meaning of the word Sankranti is \"transition\" or \"change of position\". In some regions, Simha Sankranti is also referred to asSinghudi SankrantiorSinghada Parva. The period during which the Surya moves from one Rashi to another is called Sankranti. Simha Sankranti marks the occasion of the Surya entering the Simha Rashi and is considered highly auspicious for religious activities such as performing rituals, charity, penance, holy bathing and offerings Pitru Tarpan.\n\nAccording to Vedic astrology, the ruler of Simha Rashi is the Lord Surya. Hence, when the Surya enters Simha Rashi, it is said to be in its own house, i. E., Swagruhi, which amplifies its brilliance, influence and auspiciousness. For this reason, Simha Sankranti is considered a special time for Pitru Aradhana, performing charitable deeds, conducting Shraddha rituals, and offering prayers to the Lord Surya.\n\nGrihya Sutras, Dharma Shastras and various Puranas describe Sankranti periods as especially meritorious times. Notably, texts such as theNarada Purana, Matsya Purana, Skanda PuranaandVishnu Dharmasutrastate that religious acts performed during the Sankranti period yield a thousand times more merit compared to those performed at other times. Simha Sankranti is particularly significant for ancestral rituals. Any Shraddha, Tarpan, or Pind Daan performed during this time is believed to deeply satisfy the ancestors and bring prosperity to the lineage.\n\nOn this day, one should bathe early in the morning using water mixed with Ganga water and offer Arghya to the Lord Surya. After that, Tarpan should be performed for ancestors using sesame seeds and water, then offer food with Dakshina to a Brahmin. As per scriptures, anyone who donates food, clothing, umbrellas, footwear, cows, gold or land, etc., during Sankranti with devotion and within their means, earns merit for seven lifetimes.\n\nSimha Sankranti represents the inner strength and radiance of Lord Surya. As the Lord Surya enters its own sign Simha, it becomes a symbol of spiritual energy, penance, wisdom, brilliance, and courage. Therefore, this period is especially beneficial for spiritual seekers. Various Upanishads and Yogic texts mention that Surya worship, Gayatri Mantrachanting and Pranayama performed during Sankranti lead to spiritual accomplishment.\n\nThus, Simha Sankranti is not merely an astronomical event but a significant religious festival. Those who observe fasts, do chanting, take holy baths, offer Tarpan and engage in charity on this day with devotion are blessed both materially and spiritually."

In West Bengal, Goddess Durga is worshipped on the last three days of Navratri and these three days are famously known asDurga Saptami, Durga AshtamiandDurga Navami. It would be correct to say that Durga Puja in West Bengal is a smaller version of 9 days Navratri. KalparambhaandBilva Nimantranduring Durga Puja, which is done on the sixth day of Navratri, is symbolically same as Ghatasthapana or Kalashsthapana in other states.\n\nHindu religious books suggest 7 days Navratri, 5 days Navratri, 3 days Navratri, 2 days Navratri or even 1 day Navratri as an alternative to 9 days Navratri.\n\nJyoti Kalash, Kumari Puja, Sandhi Puja, Navami Homa, Lalitha VratandChandi Pathare other famous rituals and events which are observed during 9 days Navratri."

The best time for Lakshmi Puja is during Pradosh Kaal whenSthir Lagnaprevails. Sthir means fixed i. E. Not moveable. If Lakshmi Puja is done during Sthir Lagna, Lakshmiji will stay in your home; hence this time is the best for Lakshmi Pujan. Vrishabha Lagnais considered as Sthir and mostly overlaps with Pradosh Kaal during Diwali festivity.\n\nWe provide exact window for Lakshmi Puja. Our Muhurat times contain Pradosh Kaal and Sthir Lagna while Amavasya is prevailing. We provide Muhurat based on location, hence you should select your city first before noting down Shubh Lakshmi Puja timings.\n\nMany communities especially Gujarati businessmen doChopda Pujanduring Diwali Puja. During Chopda Puja new account books are inaugurated in presence of Goddess Lakshmi to seek Her blessing for the next financial year. Diwali Puja is also known asDeepavali PujaandLakshmi Ganesh Pujan.\n\nThe whole team of www. Drikpanchang. Com wishes you happy and prosperous Diwali 2029."

Depending on people and the region, the full moon day in Hindu calendar is also referred as Poornima, Poonam, Pournami and Pournimasi. In Vaishnava tradition Kartik month is known as Damodara month. Damodara is one of the names ofLord Krishna.\n\nIn Hindu calendar, Kartik is the holiest month among all lunar months. Many people take pledge to take holy dip before sunrise in Ganges and other holy rivers every day during the month of Kartik. The ritual of holy dip during Kartik month begins on the day ofSharad Purnimaand ends on Kartik Purnima.\n\nKartik Purnima is also very significant as many rituals and festivals culminate on the day of Kartik Purnima. The festivities of Kartika Purnima begin on the day ofPrabodhini Ekadashi. Ekadashi is the eleventh day and Purnima is the fifteenth day of Kartika month during Shukla Paksha. Hence Kartik Purnima festivities last for five days.\n\nTulasi-Vivah Utsavwhich begins on the day of Prabodhini Ekadashi culminates on the day of Kartik Purnima. As per religious books, Tulasi Vivahcan be performed on any suitable day between Ekadashi to Purnima in the month of Kartik. However, many people choose the day of Kartik Purnima to perform marriage rituals ofGoddess TulasiandLord Shaligram, an iconic representation of Lord Vishnu.\n\nBhishma Panchakafasting which begins on Ekadashi day ends on the day of Kartik Purnima. In Vaishnava tradition, the utmost importance is given to Bhishma Panchaka fasting during the last five days of Kartik month. The five days fasting is known as Bhishma Panchaka as well asVishnu Panchaka.\n\nVaikuntha Chaturdashifasting and Puja is performed on Chaturdashi Tithi i. E. One day before Kartik Purnima. It is believed that Lord Vishnu worshipped Lord Shiva on the day of Kartik Chaturdashi during Shukla Paksha and offered Him one thousand lotus flowers. Many Shiva temples organize special Puja during which Lord Vishnu is worshipped along with Lord Shiva. On the day of Vaikuntha Chaturdashi, a holy dip in Ganges before Sunrise at Manikarnika Ghat in Varanasi is considered very significant among devotees of Lord Shiva.\n\nDev Diwaliwhich is also known as Diwali of Gods is celebrated on the day of Kartik Purnima. It is believed thatLord Shivakilled demonTripurasuraon the day of Kartik Purnima. Hence Kartik Purnima is also known as Tripuri Purnima andTripurari Purnima. As per legends of Tripuri Purnima, Tripurasura defeated Gods and started ruling their kingdom. When Tripurasura was killed, Gods were overjoyed and celebrated the day of Kartik Purnima as the day of illuminations. Hence thousands of earthen lamps are lit at all temples as well as at the bank of river Ganga on the day of Kartik Purnima."

All Purnima days in Hindu calendar are significant as Purnima days either coincides with important festivals or Jayanti days in the calendar.\n\nApart from festivals and Jayanti days, many families traditionally observe a day long fast on Purnimasi days in the year. Full moon days are also very significant to performSatya Narayana Puja.\n\nPhalguna Purnima, which is the last Purnima of the year, is no exception. Holithe one of the most significant and popular Hindu festivals is observed during Phalguna Purnima. The day also coincides withLakshmi Jayanti, the birth anniversary of Hindu Goddess of wealth and prosperity.\n\nPhalguna Purnima is also known asVasanta Purnima, as this Purnima coincides with Vasanta Ritu out of totalsix Ritu(s) or seasons in Vedic astrology. It is important to note that Hindu festivals are not linked with seasons as all Hindu festivals drift away from seasons due to precession. As it takes thousands of years to notice seasonal change of Hindu festivals, it is assumed that festivals are linked to seasons and festivals are given alternate names based on the season they currently coincide with.\n\nIn South Indian states, namely Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka, Phalguna Purnima is observed asKama Dahanam. The rituals of Kama Dahanam are same that ofHolika Dahanbut the legend associated with Kama Dahanam is different thanlegend of Holika Dahan. Generally Holi is considered as North Indian festival but it is also observed asKaman Pandigaiin Tamil Nadu andKamuni Pandugain Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.\n\nIn West Bengal and Orissa, Dol Purnimais observed during Phalguna Purnima. The festival of Dol Purnima is dedicated toLord Krishna. On this day, the procession of Lord Krishna is taken through streets while devotees playing Holi with Lord Krishna.\n\nPhalguna Purnima also coincides with the birth anniversary ofChaitanya Mahaprabhu. Hence the day of Phalguna Purnima is very significant for Gaudiya Vaishnava(s)."

They should offer flowers and sweet water at the root of the Vata Vriksha and tie a raw cotton thread around it while doing Parikrama. After the ritual, they should seek blessings from the elders in the family. The adornment items used for the ritual should be given to an elderly married woman. People who follow the general Purnima fast can also worship Lord Vishnu and Goddess Lakshmi under the Vat tree and chant Mantras.\n\nThis is a special type of fast, and following it properly is believed to fulfill all desires. It is described in theSkanda Purana. When the Jyeshtha Purnima falls on aTuesday, this fast is started. On that day, take a bath in the morning using mustard-mixed water, and worship theBilva Vriksha, i. E., Bael tree with Gandha and Pushpa etc. Eat only once during the day. If the food is seen by a dog, pig, or donkey, it should be discarded immediately. In this way, observe a fast on all full moon days for the next one year.

      "description": "Ratha Yatra is a huge Hindu festival and it is organized each year at famousJagannatha templeinPuri, Odisha, India. Ratha Yatra day is decided based on Hindu Lunar calendar and it is fixed on Dwitiya Tithi during Shukla Paksha of Ashada month. Currently it falls in month of June or July in Gregorian calendar.\n\nLord Jagannathais worshipped primarily in city of Puri at famous Jagannatha temple. Lord Jagannatha is considered a form of Lord Vishnu and also revered by the followers of Vaishnavism. Jagannatha literally means Lord of the Universe. Jagannatha temple is one of the four Hindu pilgrimage centers known asChar Dhampilgrimages that a Hindu is expected to make in one's lifetime. Lord Jagannatha is worshipped along with his brotherBalabhadraand his sister DeviSubhadra.\n\nRatha Yatra commemorates Lord Jagannatha's annual visit toGundicha (गुंडीचा) Mata temple. It is said that to honor the devotion ofQueen Gundicha, wife of the legendaryKing Indradyumna (इन्द्रद्युम्न)who built the Puri Jagannatha temple, the Lord Jagannatha, Balabhadra and Subhadra leave their regular abode in the main temple and spend a few days in this temple built by Gundicha in their honor.\n\nOne day before of Ratha Yatra, Gundicha Temple is cleaned by devotees of Lord Jagannatha. The ritual of cleaning Gundicha temple is known asGundicha Marjana (मार्जन)and is held one day before Ratha Yatra.\n\nThe fourth day after Ratha Yatra is celebrated asHera Panchami (हेरा पञ्चमी)whenGoddess Lakshmi, the consort of Lord Jagannatha, visits Gundicha temple in search of Lord Jagannatha. Hera Panchami should not be confused with Panchami Tithi as Hera Panchami is celebrated on the fourth day after Ratha Yatra and usually observed on Shashthi Tithi.\n\nAfter resting eight days in Gundicha temple Lord Jagannatha returns to his main abode. This day is known asBahuda (बहुदा) YatraorReturn Yatraand is observed on the eighth day after Ratha Yatra on Dashami Tithi (if we do not have any skipped or leaped Tithi during Lords' stay in Gundicha temple). During Bahuda Yatra Lord makes a short stoppage atMausi Maa templewhich is dedicated toGoddess Ardhashini.\n\nIt should be noted that Lord Jagannatha returns to his main abode just beforeDevshayani Ekadashiwhen Lord Jagannatha goes to sleep for four months. Ratha Yatra is also known asPuri Car Festivalamong foreign visitors.\n\nIt should be noted that rituals of Ratha Yatra start much ahead of Ratha Yatra day. Approximately 18 days before of Ratha Yatra Lord Jagannatha, his brother Balabhadra and his sister Devi Subhadra are given famous ceremonial bath which is known asSnana Yatra. Snana Yatra day is observed on Purnima Tithi in Jyeshtha month which is popularly known asJyestha Purnima."

This astronomical event occurs annually at the end of the month of Shravana or the beginning of Bhadrapada. The literal meaning of the word Sankranti is \"transition\" or \"change of position\". In some regions, Simha Sankranti is also referred to asSinghudi SankrantiorSinghada Parva. The period during which the Surya moves from one Rashi to another is called Sankranti. Simha Sankranti marks the occasion of the Surya entering the Simha Rashi and is considered highly auspicious for religious activities such as performing rituals, charity, penance, holy bathing and offerings Pitru Tarpan.\n\nAccording to Vedic astrology, the ruler of Simha Rashi is the Lord Surya. Hence, when the Surya enters Simha Rashi, it is said to be in its own house, i. E., Swagruhi, which amplifies its brilliance, influence and auspiciousness. For this reason, Simha Sankranti is considered a special time for Pitru Aradhana, performing charitable deeds, conducting Shraddha rituals, and offering prayers to the Lord Surya.\n\nGrihya Sutras, Dharma Shastras and various Puranas describe Sankranti periods as especially meritorious times. Notably, texts such as theNarada Purana, Matsya Purana, Skanda PuranaandVishnu Dharmasutrastate that religious acts performed during the Sankranti period yield a thousand times more merit compared to those performed at other times. Simha Sankranti is particularly significant for ancestral rituals. Any Shraddha, Tarpan, or Pind Daan performed during this time is believed to deeply satisfy the ancestors and bring prosperity to the lineage.\n\nOn this day, one should bathe early in the morning using water mixed with Ganga water and offer Arghya to the Lord Surya. After that, Tarpan should be performed for ancestors using sesame seeds and water, then offer food with Dakshina to a Brahmin. As per scriptures, anyone who donates food, clothing, umbrellas, footwear, cows, gold or land, etc., during Sankranti with devotion and within their means, earns merit for seven lifetimes.\n\nSimha Sankranti represents the inner strength and radiance of Lord Surya. As the Lord Surya enters its own sign Simha, it becomes a symbol of spiritual energy, penance, wisdom, brilliance, and courage. Therefore, this period is especially beneficial for spiritual seekers. Various Upanishads and Yogic texts mention that Surya worship, Gayatri Mantrachanting and Pranayama performed during Sankranti lead to spiritual accomplishment.\n\nThus, Simha Sankranti is not merely an astronomical event but a significant religious festival. Those who observe fasts, do chanting, take holy baths, offer Tarpan and engage in charity on this day with devotion are blessed both materially and spiritually."

The tough winter season in North makes austerity period more difficult. The daily bathing starts from Paush Purnima and ends onMagha Purnima. It is believed that all charity work done during this time are fructified easily. Hence people offer charity to needy according to their capacity.\n\nThe holy dip atDashashwamedh Ghatat Varanasi andTriveni Sangamat Prayag is considered highly auspicious and important on Paush Purnima day. It is believed that the holy dip on the auspicious day of Paush Purnima liberates the soul from the continuous cycle of the birth and the death.\n\nShakambhari Jayantiis also observed during Paush Purnima.

Sankranti activities, like taking bath, offering Naivedhya (food offered to deity) to Lord Surya, offering charity or Dakshina, performing Shraddha rituals and breaking fast or Parana, should be done during Punya Kaal.\n\nIf Makar Sankranti happens after Sunset then all Punya Kaal activities are postponed till next day Sunrise. Hence all Punya Kaal activities should be done in day time.\n\nDrikPanchang. Comsuggests Sankranti Muhurta which falls between Makar Sankranti moment and 40 Ghatis from it. We list this time asPunya Kaal Muhurta. Our holy scriptures suggest that 5 Ghatis duration after Sunrise (if Sankranti happens after Sunset on previous day) and 1 Ghati duration after Sankranti moment (if Sankranti happens in day time) are highly auspicious. If this Muhurta is available we list it asMahapunya Kaal Muhurta. Mahapunya Kaal Muhurta, if available, should be preferred over Punya Kaal Muhurta.\n\nIn Tamil Nadu Makar Sankranti or Sankranthi is known asPongal. In Gujarat and Rajasthan Makar Sankranti is known asUttarayana. In Haryana and Punjab Makar Sankranti is known asMaghi.\n\nSankranti Punya Kaal is different for all cities.

Therefore, this month is considered especially important for the eldest child in the family. On the Purnima Tithi of this month, the Chandra travels through the Jyeshtha Nakshatra. The Purnima Tithi of Jyeshtha month is also known asVat Purnima. In many regions of India, married women observe a fast on Vat Purnima for the long life of their husbands.

The day also holds special importance for worshippingLord VishnuandGoddess Lakshmi.\n\nJust like the Vat Savitri Vrat, women can observe a fast on the full moon day for good fortune and the growth of the family. Married women should take a vow for the fast, get fully adorned, and worship theVata Vriksha, i. E., banyan tree. They should offer flowers and sweet water at the root of the Vata Vriksha and tie a raw cotton thread around it while doing Parikrama. After the ritual, they should seek blessings from the elders in the family. The adornment items used for the ritual should be given to an elderly married woman. People who follow the general Purnima fast can also worship Lord Vishnu and Goddess Lakshmi under the Vat tree and chant Mantras.\n\nThis is a special type of fast, and following it properly is believed to fulfill all desires. It is described in theSkanda Purana. When the Jyeshtha Purnima falls on aTuesday, this fast is started. On that day, take a bath in the morning using mustard-mixed water, and worship theBilva Vriksha, i. E., Bael tree with Gandha and Pushpa etc. Eat only once during the day. If the food is seen by a dog, pig, or donkey, it should be discarded immediately. In this way, observe a fast on all full moon days for the next one year. On the final day of the fast, go near the Bilva tree and fill a container with aprroximatley 1 kg of grains such as barley, wheat, rice, and sesame.

Lord Jagannatha is worshipped along with his brotherBalabhadraand his sister DeviSubhadra.\n\nRatha Yatra commemorates Lord Jagannatha's annual visit toGundicha (गुंडीचा) Mata temple. It is said that to honor the devotion ofQueen Gundicha, wife of the legendaryKing Indradyumna (इन्द्रद्युम्न)who built the Puri Jagannatha temple, the Lord Jagannatha, Balabhadra and Subhadra leave their regular abode in the main temple and spend a few days in this temple built by Gundicha in their honor.\n\nOne day before of Ratha Yatra, Gundicha Temple is cleaned by devotees of Lord Jagannatha. The ritual of cleaning Gundicha temple is known asGundicha Marjana (मार्जन)and is held one day before Ratha Yatra.\n\nThe fourth day after Ratha Yatra is celebrated asHera Panchami (हेरा पञ्चमी)whenGoddess Lakshmi, the consort of Lord Jagannatha, visits Gundicha temple in search of Lord Jagannatha.

This day is known asBahuda (बहुदा) YatraorReturn Yatraand is observed on the eighth day after Ratha Yatra on Dashami Tithi (if we do not have any skipped or leaped Tithi during Lords' stay in Gundicha temple). During Bahuda Yatra Lord makes a short stoppage atMausi Maa templewhich is dedicated toGoddess Ardhashini.\n\nIt should be noted that Lord Jagannatha returns to his main abode just beforeDevshayani Ekadashiwhen Lord Jagannatha goes to sleep for four months. Ratha Yatra is also known asPuri Car Festivalamong foreign visitors.\n\nIt should be noted that rituals of Ratha Yatra start much ahead of Ratha Yatra day. Approximately 18 days before of Ratha Yatra Lord Jagannatha, his brother Balabhadra and his sister Devi Subhadra are given famous ceremonial bath which is known asSnana Yatra.

This astronomical event occurs annually at the end of the month of Shravana or the beginning of Bhadrapada. The literal meaning of the word Sankranti is \"transition\" or \"change of position\". In some regions, Simha Sankranti is also referred to asSinghudi SankrantiorSinghada Parva. The period during which the Surya moves from one Rashi to another is called Sankranti. Simha Sankranti marks the occasion of the Surya entering the Simha Rashi and is considered highly auspicious for religious activities such as performing rituals, charity, penance, holy bathing and offerings Pitru Tarpan.\n\nAccording to Vedic astrology, the ruler of Simha Rashi is the Lord Surya. Hence, when the Surya enters Simha Rashi, it is said to be in its own house, i. E., Swagruhi, which amplifies its brilliance, influence and auspiciousness. For this reason, Simha Sankranti is considered a special time for Pitru Aradhana, performing charitable deeds, conducting Shraddha rituals, and offering prayers to the Lord Surya.\n\nGrihya Sutras, Dharma Shastras and various Puranas describe Sankranti periods as especially meritorious times. Notably, texts such as theNarada Purana, Matsya Purana, Skanda PuranaandVishnu Dharmasutrastate that religious acts performed during the Sankranti period yield a thousand times more merit compared to those performed at other times. Simha Sankranti is particularly significant for ancestral rituals. Any Shraddha, Tarpan, or Pind Daan performed during this time is believed to deeply satisfy the ancestors and bring prosperity to the lineage.\n\nOn this day, one should bathe early in the morning using water mixed with Ganga water and offer Arghya to the Lord Surya. After that, Tarpan should be performed for ancestors using sesame seeds and water, then offer food with Dakshina to a Brahmin. As per scriptures, anyone who donates food, clothing, umbrellas, footwear, cows, gold or land, etc., during Sankranti with devotion and within their means, earns merit for seven lifetimes.\n\nSimha Sankranti represents the inner strength and radiance of Lord Surya. As the Lord Surya enters its own sign Simha, it becomes a symbol of spiritual energy, penance, wisdom, brilliance, and courage. Therefore, this period is especially beneficial for spiritual seekers. Various Upanishads and Yogic texts mention that Surya worship, Gayatri Mantrachanting and Pranayama performed during Sankranti lead to spiritual accomplishment.\n\nThus, Simha Sankranti is not merely an astronomical event but a significant religious festival. Those who observe fasts, do chanting, take holy baths, offer Tarpan and engage in charity on this day with devotion are blessed both materially and spiritually."

Apart from Ganesha Visarjan, Anant Chaturdashi is very significant day to worshipLord Vishnuin Anant form. Devotees of Lord Vishnu observe a day long fast and tie sacred thread during Puja.

Ganesha Visarjan is also known asVinayaka Nimajjanamin Telugu speaking regions.\n\nOn the eleventh day the statue ofLord Ganeshais immersed into water body, preferably in a river, lake or the sea. After the final offering of coconuts, flowers and sweets, the statues of Lord Ganesha are taken to the water body through the street procession with much fanfare. Thousands of devotees join the procession and fill the whole atmosphere with chanting of Lord Ganesha. \"Ganapati Bappa Morya\" and \"Ganesh Maharaj Ki, Jai\" are few of the famous slogans which are chanted throughout the procession.\n\nIn Mumbai, Ganesha Visarjan is performed under the guidance of Ganpati Mandals. The street procession is accompanied with Dhol, Tasha and the other traditional instruments. Ganesha Visarjan continues throughout the night till the next morning.\n\nFew families perform Ganesha Visarjan on the 3rd, 5th or 7th day rather performing it on the 11th day as per their family tradition. The idol of Lord Ganesha can be immersed in the water of tub or bucket."

Damodara is one of the names ofLord Krishna.\n\nIn Hindu calendar, Kartik is the holiest month among all lunar months. Many people take pledge to take holy dip before sunrise in Ganges and other holy rivers every day during the month of Kartik.

The five days fasting is known as Bhishma Panchaka as well asVishnu Panchaka.\n\nVaikuntha Chaturdashifasting and Puja is performed on Chaturdashi Tithi i. E. One day before Kartik Purnima.

It is said that to honor the devotion ofQueen Gundicha, wife of the legendaryKing Indradyumna (इन्द्रद्युम्न)who built the Puri Jagannatha temple, the Lord Jagannatha, Balabhadra and Subhadra leave their regular abode in the main temple and spend a few days in this temple built by Gundicha in their honor.\n\nOne day before of Ratha Yatra, Gundicha Temple is cleaned by devotees of Lord Jagannatha.

This astronomical event occurs annually at the end of the month of Shravana or the beginning of Bhadrapada. The literal meaning of the word Sankranti is \"transition\" or \"change of position\". In some regions, Simha Sankranti is also referred to asSinghudi SankrantiorSinghada Parva. The period during which the Surya moves from one Rashi to another is called Sankranti. Simha Sankranti marks the occasion of the Surya entering the Simha Rashi and is considered highly auspicious for religious activities such as performing rituals, charity, penance, holy bathing and offerings Pitru Tarpan.\n\nAccording to Vedic astrology, the ruler of Simha Rashi is the Lord Surya. Hence, when the Surya enters Simha Rashi, it is said to be in its own house, i. E., Swagruhi, which amplifies its brilliance, influence and auspiciousness. For this reason, Simha Sankranti is considered a special time for Pitru Aradhana, performing charitable deeds, conducting Shraddha rituals, and offering prayers to the Lord Surya.\n\nGrihya Sutras, Dharma Shastras and various Puranas describe Sankranti periods as especially meritorious times. Notably, texts such as theNarada Purana, Matsya Purana, Skanda PuranaandVishnu Dharmasutrastate that religious acts performed during the Sankranti period yield a thousand times more merit compared to those performed at other times. Simha Sankranti is particularly significant for ancestral rituals. Any Shraddha, Tarpan, or Pind Daan performed during this time is believed to deeply satisfy the ancestors and bring prosperity to the lineage.\n\nOn this day, one should bathe early in the morning using water mixed with Ganga water and offer Arghya to the Lord Surya. After that, Tarpan should be performed for ancestors using sesame seeds and water, then offer food with Dakshina to a Brahmin. As per scriptures, anyone who donates food, clothing, umbrellas, footwear, cows, gold or land, etc., during Sankranti with devotion and within their means, earns merit for seven lifetimes.\n\nSimha Sankranti represents the inner strength and radiance of Lord Surya. As the Lord Surya enters its own sign Simha, it becomes a symbol of spiritual energy, penance, wisdom, brilliance, and courage. Therefore, this period is especially beneficial for spiritual seekers. Various Upanishads and Yogic texts mention that Surya worship, Gayatri Mantrachanting and Pranayama performed during Sankranti lead to spiritual accomplishment.\n\nThus, Simha Sankranti is not merely an astronomical event but a significant religious festival. Those who observe fasts, do chanting, take holy baths, offer Tarpan and engage in charity on this day with devotion are blessed both materially and spiritually."

Hence one should wait for Bhadra to get over before starting any auspicious work. In North India it is customary to tie Rakhi in the morning which might not be suitable time to do it. The DrikPanchang's team believes that it might be due to ignorance. When such information is easily available one should avoid tying Rakhi during Bhadra.\n\nSome sources advise to avoid Bhadra Mukha and perform Rakhi ceremony during Bhadra Punchha if it has to be done during Bhadra in early morning. However our team was not able to find any authority to validate this belief.\n\nTo avoid doing Rakhi ceremony at an inauspicious time it is advisable to check some Panchang like DrikPanchang.

In the name Gangaur, GanameansLord Shivaand Gaur meansMata Parvati.\n\nOn the day of Gangaur, unmarried girls and married women worship Lord Shiva and Mother Parvati. In many areas, Lord Shiva is worshiped asIsar Jiand Goddess Parvati is worshiped asGaura Mata. Gaura ji is also known asGawarja ji. According to religious scriptures, by observing this fast with full devotion, unmarried girls get their desired groom, and husbands of married women live long and healthy.\n\nIn the worship of Gangaur, women make Gaura ji of sand or clay and decorate it completely. After that, they worship him with rituals and sing folk songs.\n\nAccording toVratotsav Sangraha, on this day, by observing fast by drinking milk only once in the day, a woman gets the eternal happiness of her husband and daughter.\n\nThe specialty of this fast is that it is observed secretly from the husband. Even the Prasadam of Gangaur Puja are not given to the husband. To know the reason behind this, you should readGangaur Vrat Katha.\n\nOn the third day of Chaitra Navratri, women do sixteen adornments and perform fast and worship and in the evening they read and listen to the story of Gangaur fast. This day is also known asBadi Gangaur. On this day, the idol of Mata Gaura made of sand near a river or lake is given water to drink. The goddess is immersed on the next day of this puja. The place where Gangaur puja is performed is considered as Gangaur'sPeharor maternal house and the place where immersion takes place is considered as herin-laws' house.\n\nOn the day of Gangaur Puja, women make jewelery by mixing turmeric in flour, gram flour or flour, which is offered to Goddess Parvati. These ornaments are called Gune. According to beliefs, the more gold coins women offer to Goddess Parvati on the day of Badi Gangaur, the more wealth and prosperity the family receives. After the Puja is over, women give the Guna to theirmother-in-law, andsister-in-laws. According to some scholars, the word Guna has become a corruption of the word Jewel.\n\nIn Rajasthan, the festival of Gangaur is celebrated as an 18-day festival. There the Gangaur festival starts from Chaitra Krishna Pratipada, the next day of Holika Dahan and ends on Chaitra Shukla Tritiya. In Rajasthan, women worship Isar Ji and Gawarja Ji on this day. During the puja, she sprinkles water from the grass and sings a traditional song called \"Gor Gor Gomti\".\n\nAccording to local beliefs, Mata Gawarja comes to her maternal home on the second day of Holi and after eighteen days Isar Ji comes to take her back. Gawarja ji is bid farewell onChaitra Shukla Tritiya.\n\nIn Rajasthan and other rural areas, folk songs sung in the worship of Gangaur are an essential part of this festival. Through the songs of Gangaur, women worship Mother Gawarja as their elder sister and Lord Isar as their brother-in-law. In many areas of Rajasthan, Gangaur worship is mandatory at the time of marriage.\n\nThe festival of Gangaur is celebrated on a very large scale in Nimar, Madhya Pradesh. At the conclusion of Gangaur Utsav, Bhandara is organized in every village on the last day. After this, Mata Gawarja is bid farewell along with Isar Ji."

Therefore, this month is considered especially important for the eldest child in the family. On the Purnima Tithi of this month, the Chandra travels through the Jyeshtha Nakshatra. The Purnima Tithi of Jyeshtha month is also known asVat Purnima. In many regions of India, married women observe a fast on Vat Purnima for the long life of their husbands.

Married women should take a vow for the fast, get fully adorned, and worship theVata Vriksha, i. E., banyan tree. They should offer flowers and sweet water at the root of the Vata Vriksha and tie a raw cotton thread around it while doing Parikrama. After the ritual, they should seek blessings from the elders in the family. The adornment items used for the ritual should be given to an elderly married woman. People who follow the general Purnima fast can also worship Lord Vishnu and Goddess Lakshmi under the Vat tree and chant Mantras.\n\nThis is a special type of fast, and following it properly is believed to fulfill all desires. It is described in theSkanda Purana. When the Jyeshtha Purnima falls on aTuesday, this fast is started. On that day, take a bath in the morning using mustard-mixed water, and worship theBilva Vriksha, i. E., Bael tree with Gandha and Pushpa etc. Eat only once during the day. If the food is seen by a dog, pig, or donkey, it should be discarded immediately. In this way, observe a fast on all full moon days for the next one year.

This astronomical event occurs annually at the end of the month of Shravana or the beginning of Bhadrapada. The literal meaning of the word Sankranti is \"transition\" or \"change of position\". In some regions, Simha Sankranti is also referred to asSinghudi SankrantiorSinghada Parva. The period during which the Surya moves from one Rashi to another is called Sankranti. Simha Sankranti marks the occasion of the Surya entering the Simha Rashi and is considered highly auspicious for religious activities such as performing rituals, charity, penance, holy bathing and offerings Pitru Tarpan.\n\nAccording to Vedic astrology, the ruler of Simha Rashi is the Lord Surya. Hence, when the Surya enters Simha Rashi, it is said to be in its own house, i. E., Swagruhi, which amplifies its brilliance, influence and auspiciousness. For this reason, Simha Sankranti is considered a special time for Pitru Aradhana, performing charitable deeds, conducting Shraddha rituals, and offering prayers to the Lord Surya.\n\nGrihya Sutras, Dharma Shastras and various Puranas describe Sankranti periods as especially meritorious times. Notably, texts such as theNarada Purana, Matsya Purana, Skanda PuranaandVishnu Dharmasutrastate that religious acts performed during the Sankranti period yield a thousand times more merit compared to those performed at other times. Simha Sankranti is particularly significant for ancestral rituals. Any Shraddha, Tarpan, or Pind Daan performed during this time is believed to deeply satisfy the ancestors and bring prosperity to the lineage.\n\nOn this day, one should bathe early in the morning using water mixed with Ganga water and offer Arghya to the Lord Surya. After that, Tarpan should be performed for ancestors using sesame seeds and water, then offer food with Dakshina to a Brahmin. As per scriptures, anyone who donates food, clothing, umbrellas, footwear, cows, gold or land, etc., during Sankranti with devotion and within their means, earns merit for seven lifetimes.\n\nSimha Sankranti represents the inner strength and radiance of Lord Surya. As the Lord Surya enters its own sign Simha, it becomes a symbol of spiritual energy, penance, wisdom, brilliance, and courage. Therefore, this period is especially beneficial for spiritual seekers. Various Upanishads and Yogic texts mention that Surya worship, Gayatri Mantrachanting and Pranayama performed during Sankranti lead to spiritual accomplishment.\n\nThus, Simha Sankranti is not merely an astronomical event but a significant religious festival. Those who observe fasts, do chanting, take holy baths, offer Tarpan and engage in charity on this day with devotion are blessed both materially and spiritually."

It is important to note that all these days are in odd numbers. Even the most important day of Ganesha Visarjan, which falls on Anant Chaturdashi day, is the 11th day from the day of Ganesha Chaturthi.\n\nAnant Chaturdashi is the most significant day for Ganesha Visarjan.

Ganesha Visarjan is also known asVinayaka Nimajjanamin Telugu speaking regions.\n\nOn the eleventh day the statue ofLord Ganeshais immersed into water body, preferably in a river, lake or the sea. After the final offering of coconuts, flowers and sweets, the statues of Lord Ganesha are taken to the water body through the street procession with much fanfare. Thousands of devotees join the procession and fill the whole atmosphere with chanting of Lord Ganesha. \"Ganapati Bappa Morya\" and \"Ganesh Maharaj Ki, Jai\" are few of the famous slogans which are chanted throughout the procession.\n\nIn Mumbai, Ganesha Visarjan is performed under the guidance of Ganpati Mandals. The street procession is accompanied with Dhol, Tasha and the other traditional instruments. Ganesha Visarjan continues throughout the night till the next morning.\n\nFew families perform Ganesha Visarjan on the 3rd, 5th or 7th day rather performing it on the 11th day as per their family tradition. The idol of Lord Ganesha can be immersed in the water of tub or bucket."

The fasting of Karwa Chauth and its rituals are observed by married women for the long life of their husband. Married women worshipLord Shivaand His family including Lord Ganesha and break the fast only after sighting and making the offerings to the moon. The fasting of Karwa Chauth is strict and observed without taking any food or even a drop of water after sunrise till the sighting of the moon in the night.\n\nKarwa Chauth day is also known asKarak Chaturthi (करक चतुर्थी). Karwa or Karak refers to the earthen pot through which water offering, known asArgha (अर्घ), is made to the moon. Karwa is very significant during Puja and it is also given as Dan to the Brahmin or any eligible woman.\n\nCompare to South Indian states, Karwa Chauth is more popular in North Indian states.

Depending on people and the region, the full moon day in Hindu calendar is also referred as Poornima, Poonam, Pournami and Pournimasi. In Vaishnava tradition Kartik month is known as Damodara month. Damodara is one of the names ofLord Krishna.\n\nIn Hindu calendar, Kartik is the holiest month among all lunar months. Many people take pledge to take holy dip before sunrise in Ganges and other holy rivers every day during the month of Kartik. The ritual of holy dip during Kartik month begins on the day ofSharad Purnimaand ends on Kartik Purnima.\n\nKartik Purnima is also very significant as many rituals and festivals culminate on the day of Kartik Purnima. The festivities of Kartika Purnima begin on the day ofPrabodhini Ekadashi. Ekadashi is the eleventh day and Purnima is the fifteenth day of Kartika month during Shukla Paksha. Hence Kartik Purnima festivities last for five days.\n\nTulasi-Vivah Utsavwhich begins on the day of Prabodhini Ekadashi culminates on the day of Kartik Purnima. As per religious books, Tulasi Vivahcan be performed on any suitable day between Ekadashi to Purnima in the month of Kartik. However, many people choose the day of Kartik Purnima to perform marriage rituals ofGoddess TulasiandLord Shaligram, an iconic representation of Lord Vishnu.\n\nBhishma Panchakafasting which begins on Ekadashi day ends on the day of Kartik Purnima. In Vaishnava tradition, the utmost importance is given to Bhishma Panchaka fasting during the last five days of Kartik month. The five days fasting is known as Bhishma Panchaka as well asVishnu Panchaka.\n\nVaikuntha Chaturdashifasting and Puja is performed on Chaturdashi Tithi i. E. One day before Kartik Purnima. It is believed that Lord Vishnu worshipped Lord Shiva on the day of Kartik Chaturdashi during Shukla Paksha and offered Him one thousand lotus flowers. Many Shiva temples organize special Puja during which Lord Vishnu is worshipped along with Lord Shiva. On the day of Vaikuntha Chaturdashi, a holy dip in Ganges before Sunrise at Manikarnika Ghat in Varanasi is considered very significant among devotees of Lord Shiva.\n\nDev Diwaliwhich is also known as Diwali of Gods is celebrated on the day of Kartik Purnima. It is believed thatLord Shivakilled demonTripurasuraon the day of Kartik Purnima. Hence Kartik Purnima is also known as Tripuri Purnima andTripurari Purnima. As per legends of Tripuri Purnima, Tripurasura defeated Gods and started ruling their kingdom. When Tripurasura was killed, Gods were overjoyed and celebrated the day of Kartik Purnima as the day of illuminations. Hence thousands of earthen lamps are lit at all temples as well as at the bank of river Ganga on the day of Kartik Purnima."

Ghatasthapana is prohibited during Amavasya and night time.\n\nThe most auspicious or Shubh time to do Ghatasthapana is first one third of the day while Pratipada is prevailing. If due to some reasons this time is not available then Ghatasthapana can be done duringAbhijit Muhurta. It is advised to avoidNakshatra ChitraandVaidhriti Yogaduring Ghatasthapana but those are not prohibited.

During Shardiya Navratri Dvi-Svabhava LagnaKanyaprevails during sunrise and if suitable we take it for Ghatasthapana Muhurta.\n\nThe factors which are prohibited for Ghatasthapana are afternoon, night time and any time beyond sixteen Ghatis after sunrise.\n\nGhatasthapana is also known asKalash SthapanaorKalashsthapana.

It is said that to honor the devotion ofQueen Gundicha, wife of the legendaryKing Indradyumna (इन्द्रद्युम्न)who built the Puri Jagannatha temple, the Lord Jagannatha, Balabhadra and Subhadra leave their regular abode in the main temple and spend a few days in this temple built by Gundicha in their honor.\n\nOne day before of Ratha Yatra, Gundicha Temple is cleaned by devotees of Lord Jagannatha.

This day is known asBahuda (बहुदा) YatraorReturn Yatraand is observed on the eighth day after Ratha Yatra on Dashami Tithi (if we do not have any skipped or leaped Tithi during Lords' stay in Gundicha temple).

      "summary": "Karka to Simha transit of Sun",
      "description": "According to the Hindu Panchang, the time when theLord Suryatransits from theKarka RashitoSimha Rashiis known as Simha Sankranti. This astronomical event occurs annually at the end of the month of Shravana or the beginning of Bhadrapada. The literal meaning of the word Sankranti is \"transition\" or \"change of position\". In some regions, Simha Sankranti is also referred to asSinghudi SankrantiorSinghada Parva. The period during which the Surya moves from one Rashi to another is called Sankranti. Simha Sankranti marks the occasion of the Surya entering the Simha Rashi and is considered highly auspicious for religious activities such as performing rituals, charity, penance, holy bathing and offerings Pitru Tarpan.\n\nAccording to Vedic astrology, the ruler of Simha Rashi is the Lord Surya. Hence, when the Surya enters Simha Rashi, it is said to be in its own house, i. E., Swagruhi, which amplifies its brilliance, influence and auspiciousness. For this reason, Simha Sankranti is considered a special time for Pitru Aradhana, performing charitable deeds, conducting Shraddha rituals, and offering prayers to the Lord Surya.\n\nGrihya Sutras, Dharma Shastras and various Puranas describe Sankranti periods as especially meritorious times. Notably, texts such as theNarada Purana, Matsya Purana, Skanda PuranaandVishnu Dharmasutrastate that religious acts performed during the Sankranti period yield a thousand times more merit compared to those performed at other times. Simha Sankranti is particularly significant for ancestral rituals. Any Shraddha, Tarpan, or Pind Daan performed during this time is believed to deeply satisfy the ancestors and bring prosperity to the lineage.\n\nOn this day, one should bathe early in the morning using water mixed with Ganga water and offer Arghya to the Lord Surya. After that, Tarpan should be performed for ancestors using sesame seeds and water, then offer food with Dakshina to a Brahmin. As per scriptures, anyone who donates food, clothing, umbrellas, footwear, cows, gold or land, etc., during Sankranti with devotion and within their means, earns merit for seven lifetimes.\n\nSimha Sankranti represents the inner strength and radiance of Lord Surya. As the Lord Surya enters its own sign Simha, it becomes a symbol of spiritual energy, penance, wisdom, brilliance, and courage. Therefore, this period is especially beneficial for spiritual seekers. Various Upanishads and Yogic texts mention that Surya worship, Gayatri Mantrachanting and Pranayama performed during Sankranti lead to spiritual accomplishment.\n\nThus, Simha Sankranti is not merely an astronomical event but a significant religious festival. Those who observe fasts, do chanting, take holy baths, offer Tarpan and engage in charity on this day with devotion are blessed both materially and spiritually."

If Bhadra prevails during Pradosh but it ends before midnight then Holika Dahan should be done after Bhadra is over. If Bhadra is getting over after midnight then only Holika Dahan should be done in Bhadra and preferably duringBhadra Punchha. However one should avoid Bhadra Mukha and in no condition Holika Dahan should be done inBhadra Mukha. Doing so brings bad luck for the whole year not only for individuals but for whole city and country. Many times Bhadra Punchha is not available between Pradosh and midnight. In such situations one should do Holika Dahan during Pradosh. In rare occasions when neither Pradosh nor Bhadra Punchha is available then one should do Holika Dahan after Pradosh.\n\nChoosing right Muhurta for Holika Dahan is more important than choosing right Muhurta for any other festivals.

All Purnima days in Hindu calendar are significant as Purnima days either coincides with important festivals or Jayanti days in the calendar.\n\nApart from festivals and Jayanti days, many families traditionally observe a day long fast on Purnimasi days in the year. Full moon days are also very significant to performSatya Narayana Puja.\n\nPhalguna Purnima, which is the last Purnima of the year, is no exception. Holithe one of the most significant and popular Hindu festivals is observed during Phalguna Purnima. The day also coincides withLakshmi Jayanti, the birth anniversary of Hindu Goddess of wealth and prosperity.\n\nPhalguna Purnima is also known asVasanta Purnima, as this Purnima coincides with Vasanta Ritu out of totalsix Ritu(s) or seasons in Vedic astrology. It is important to note that Hindu festivals are not linked with seasons as all Hindu festivals drift away from seasons due to precession. As it takes thousands of years to notice seasonal change of Hindu festivals, it is assumed that festivals are linked to seasons and festivals are given alternate names based on the season they currently coincide with.\n\nIn South Indian states, namely Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka, Phalguna Purnima is observed asKama Dahanam. The rituals of Kama Dahanam are same that ofHolika Dahanbut the legend associated with Kama Dahanam is different thanlegend of Holika Dahan. Generally Holi is considered as North Indian festival but it is also observed asKaman Pandigaiin Tamil Nadu andKamuni Pandugain Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.\n\nIn West Bengal and Orissa, Dol Purnimais observed during Phalguna Purnima. The festival of Dol Purnima is dedicated toLord Krishna. On this day, the procession of Lord Krishna is taken through streets while devotees playing Holi with Lord Krishna.\n\nPhalguna Purnima also coincides with the birth anniversary ofChaitanya Mahaprabhu. Hence the day of Phalguna Purnima is very significant for Gaudiya Vaishnava(s)."

They should offer flowers and sweet water at the root of the Vata Vriksha and tie a raw cotton thread around it while doing Parikrama. After the ritual, they should seek blessings from the elders in the family. The adornment items used for the ritual should be given to an elderly married woman. People who follow the general Purnima fast can also worship Lord Vishnu and Goddess Lakshmi under the Vat tree and chant Mantras.\n\nThis is a special type of fast, and following it properly is believed to fulfill all desires. It is described in theSkanda Purana. When the Jyeshtha Purnima falls on aTuesday, this fast is started.

Ratha Yatra day is decided based on Hindu Lunar calendar and it is fixed on Dwitiya Tithi during Shukla Paksha of Ashada month. Currently it falls in month of June or July in Gregorian calendar.\n\nLord Jagannathais worshipped primarily in city of Puri at famous Jagannatha temple. Lord Jagannatha is considered a form of Lord Vishnu and also revered by the followers of Vaishnavism. Jagannatha literally means Lord of the Universe. Jagannatha temple is one of the four Hindu pilgrimage centers known asChar Dhampilgrimages that a Hindu is expected to make in one's lifetime. Lord Jagannatha is worshipped along with his brotherBalabhadraand his sister DeviSubhadra.\n\nRatha Yatra commemorates Lord Jagannatha's annual visit toGundicha (गुंडीचा) Mata temple. It is said that to honor the devotion ofQueen Gundicha, wife of the legendaryKing Indradyumna (इन्द्रद्युम्न)who built the Puri Jagannatha temple, the Lord Jagannatha, Balabhadra and Subhadra leave their regular abode in the main temple and spend a few days in this temple built by Gundicha in their honor.\n\nOne day before of Ratha Yatra, Gundicha Temple is cleaned by devotees of Lord Jagannatha. The ritual of cleaning Gundicha temple is known asGundicha Marjana (मार्जन)and is held one day before Ratha Yatra.\n\nThe fourth day after Ratha Yatra is celebrated asHera Panchami (हेरा पञ्चमी)whenGoddess Lakshmi, the consort of Lord Jagannatha, visits Gundicha temple in search of Lord Jagannatha. Hera Panchami should not be confused with Panchami Tithi as Hera Panchami is celebrated on the fourth day after Ratha Yatra and usually observed on Shashthi Tithi.\n\nAfter resting eight days in Gundicha temple Lord Jagannatha returns to his main abode. This day is known asBahuda (बहुदा) YatraorReturn Yatraand is observed on the eighth day after Ratha Yatra on Dashami Tithi (if we do not have any skipped or leaped Tithi during Lords' stay in Gundicha temple). During Bahuda Yatra Lord makes a short stoppage atMausi Maa templewhich is dedicated toGoddess Ardhashini.\n\nIt should be noted that Lord Jagannatha returns to his main abode just beforeDevshayani Ekadashiwhen Lord Jagannatha goes to sleep for four months. Ratha Yatra is also known asPuri Car Festivalamong foreign visitors.\n\nIt should be noted that rituals of Ratha Yatra start much ahead of Ratha Yatra day. Approximately 18 days before of Ratha Yatra Lord Jagannatha, his brother Balabhadra and his sister Devi Subhadra are given famous ceremonial bath which is known asSnana Yatra. Snana Yatra day is observed on Purnima Tithi in Jyeshtha month which is popularly known asJyestha Purnima."

This astronomical event occurs annually at the end of the month of Shravana or the beginning of Bhadrapada. The literal meaning of the word Sankranti is \"transition\" or \"change of position\". In some regions, Simha Sankranti is also referred to asSinghudi SankrantiorSinghada Parva. The period during which the Surya moves from one Rashi to another is called Sankranti. Simha Sankranti marks the occasion of the Surya entering the Simha Rashi and is considered highly auspicious for religious activities such as performing rituals, charity, penance, holy bathing and offerings Pitru Tarpan.\n\nAccording to Vedic astrology, the ruler of Simha Rashi is the Lord Surya. Hence, when the Surya enters Simha Rashi, it is said to be in its own house, i. E., Swagruhi, which amplifies its brilliance, influence and auspiciousness. For this reason, Simha Sankranti is considered a special time for Pitru Aradhana, performing charitable deeds, conducting Shraddha rituals, and offering prayers to the Lord Surya.\n\nGrihya Sutras, Dharma Shastras and various Puranas describe Sankranti periods as especially meritorious times. Notably, texts such as theNarada Purana, Matsya Purana, Skanda PuranaandVishnu Dharmasutrastate that religious acts performed during the Sankranti period yield a thousand times more merit compared to those performed at other times. Simha Sankranti is particularly significant for ancestral rituals. Any Shraddha, Tarpan, or Pind Daan performed during this time is believed to deeply satisfy the ancestors and bring prosperity to the lineage.\n\nOn this day, one should bathe early in the morning using water mixed with Ganga water and offer Arghya to the Lord Surya. After that, Tarpan should be performed for ancestors using sesame seeds and water, then offer food with Dakshina to a Brahmin. As per scriptures, anyone who donates food, clothing, umbrellas, footwear, cows, gold or land, etc., during Sankranti with devotion and within their means, earns merit for seven lifetimes.\n\nSimha Sankranti represents the inner strength and radiance of Lord Surya. As the Lord Surya enters its own sign Simha, it becomes a symbol of spiritual energy, penance, wisdom, brilliance, and courage. Therefore, this period is especially beneficial for spiritual seekers. Various Upanishads and Yogic texts mention that Surya worship, Gayatri Mantrachanting and Pranayama performed during Sankranti lead to spiritual accomplishment.\n\nThus, Simha Sankranti is not merely an astronomical event but a significant religious festival. Those who observe fasts, do chanting, take holy baths, offer Tarpan and engage in charity on this day with devotion are blessed both materially and spiritually."

For common people we propose Pradosh Kaal Muhurat.\n\nWe don't advise to chooseChoghadiya Muhuratto perform Lakshmi Puja as those Muhurtas are good only for travelling. The best time for Lakshmi Puja is during Pradosh Kaal whenSthir Lagnaprevails. Sthir means fixed i. E. Not moveable. If Lakshmi Puja is done during Sthir Lagna, Lakshmiji will stay in your home; hence this time is the best for Lakshmi Pujan. Vrishabha Lagnais considered as Sthir and mostly overlaps with Pradosh Kaal during Diwali festivity.\n\nWe provide exact window for Lakshmi Puja. Our Muhurat times contain Pradosh Kaal and Sthir Lagna while Amavasya is prevailing. We provide Muhurat based on location, hence you should select your city first before noting down Shubh Lakshmi Puja timings.\n\nMany communities especially Gujarati businessmen doChopda Pujanduring Diwali Puja. During Chopda Puja new account books are inaugurated in presence of Goddess Lakshmi to seek Her blessing for the next financial year. Diwali Puja is also known asDeepavali PujaandLakshmi Ganesh Pujan.\n\nThe whole team of www. Drikpanchang. Com wishes you happy and prosperous Diwali 2035."

Depending on people and the region, the full moon day in Hindu calendar is also referred as Poornima, Poonam, Pournami and Pournimasi. In Vaishnava tradition Kartik month is known as Damodara month. Damodara is one of the names ofLord Krishna.\n\nIn Hindu calendar, Kartik is the holiest month among all lunar months. Many people take pledge to take holy dip before sunrise in Ganges and other holy rivers every day during the month of Kartik. The ritual of holy dip during Kartik month begins on the day ofSharad Purnimaand ends on Kartik Purnima.\n\nKartik Purnima is also very significant as many rituals and festivals culminate on the day of Kartik Purnima. The festivities of Kartika Purnima begin on the day ofPrabodhini Ekadashi. Ekadashi is the eleventh day and Purnima is the fifteenth day of Kartika month during Shukla Paksha. Hence Kartik Purnima festivities last for five days.\n\nTulasi-Vivah Utsavwhich begins on the day of Prabodhini Ekadashi culminates on the day of Kartik Purnima. As per religious books, Tulasi Vivahcan be performed on any suitable day between Ekadashi to Purnima in the month of Kartik. However, many people choose the day of Kartik Purnima to perform marriage rituals ofGoddess TulasiandLord Shaligram, an iconic representation of Lord Vishnu.\n\nBhishma Panchakafasting which begins on Ekadashi day ends on the day of Kartik Purnima. In Vaishnava tradition, the utmost importance is given to Bhishma Panchaka fasting during the last five days of Kartik month. The five days fasting is known as Bhishma Panchaka as well asVishnu Panchaka.\n\nVaikuntha Chaturdashifasting and Puja is performed on Chaturdashi Tithi i. E. One day before Kartik Purnima. It is believed that Lord Vishnu worshipped Lord Shiva on the day of Kartik Chaturdashi during Shukla Paksha and offered Him one thousand lotus flowers. Many Shiva temples organize special Puja during which Lord Vishnu is worshipped along with Lord Shiva. On the day of Vaikuntha Chaturdashi, a holy dip in Ganges before Sunrise at Manikarnika Ghat in Varanasi is considered very significant among devotees of Lord Shiva.\n\nDev Diwaliwhich is also known as Diwali of Gods is celebrated on the day of Kartik Purnima. It is believed thatLord Shivakilled demonTripurasuraon the day of Kartik Purnima. Hence Kartik Purnima is also known as Tripuri Purnima andTripurari Purnima. As per legends of Tripuri Purnima, Tripurasura defeated Gods and started ruling their kingdom. When Tripurasura was killed, Gods were overjoyed and celebrated the day of Kartik Purnima as the day of illuminations. Hence thousands of earthen lamps are lit at all temples as well as at the bank of river Ganga on the day of Kartik Purnima."

All Ekadashi fasting are dedicated toGoddess Ekadashiwho is one of the Shaktis of Lord Vishnu. Ekadashi was born out of Lord Vishnu to annihilate Demon Mur who intended to kill sleeping Lord Vishnu. Hence Goddess Ekadashi is one of the protective powers of Lord Vishnu.

Full moon days are also very significant to performSatya Narayana Puja.\n\nPhalguna Purnima, which is the last Purnima of the year, is no exception. Holithe one of the most significant and popular Hindu festivals is observed during Phalguna Purnima. The day also coincides withLakshmi Jayanti, the birth anniversary of Hindu Goddess of wealth and prosperity.\n\nPhalguna Purnima is also known asVasanta Purnima, as this Purnima coincides with Vasanta Ritu out of totalsix Ritu(s) or seasons in Vedic astrology. It is important to note that Hindu festivals are not linked with seasons as all Hindu festivals drift away from seasons due to precession. As it takes thousands of years to notice seasonal change of Hindu festivals, it is assumed that festivals are linked to seasons and festivals are given alternate names based on the season they currently coincide with.\n\nIn South Indian states, namely Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka, Phalguna Purnima is observed asKama Dahanam. The rituals of Kama Dahanam are same that ofHolika Dahanbut the legend associated with Kama Dahanam is different thanlegend of Holika Dahan. Generally Holi is considered as North Indian festival but it is also observed asKaman Pandigaiin Tamil Nadu andKamuni Pandugain Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.\n\nIn West Bengal and Orissa, Dol Purnimais observed during Phalguna Purnima. The festival of Dol Purnima is dedicated toLord Krishna. On this day, the procession of Lord Krishna is taken through streets while devotees playing Holi with Lord Krishna.\n\nPhalguna Purnima also coincides with the birth anniversary ofChaitanya Mahaprabhu. Hence the day of Phalguna Purnima is very significant for Gaudiya Vaishnava(s)."

People who follow the general Purnima fast can also worship Lord Vishnu and Goddess Lakshmi under the Vat tree and chant Mantras.\n\nThis is a special type of fast, and following it properly is believed to fulfill all desires.

Lord Jagannatha is worshipped along with his brotherBalabhadraand his sister DeviSubhadra.\n\nRatha Yatra commemorates Lord Jagannatha's annual visit toGundicha (गुंडीचा) Mata temple. It is said that to honor the devotion ofQueen Gundicha, wife of the legendaryKing Indradyumna (इन्द्रद्युम्न)who built the Puri Jagannatha temple, the Lord Jagannatha, Balabhadra and Subhadra leave their regular abode in the main temple and spend a few days in this temple built by Gundicha in their honor.\n\nOne day before of Ratha Yatra, Gundicha Temple is cleaned by devotees of Lord Jagannatha. The ritual of cleaning Gundicha temple is known asGundicha Marjana (मार्जन)and is held one day before Ratha Yatra.\n\nThe fourth day after Ratha Yatra is celebrated asHera Panchami (हेरा पञ्चमी)whenGoddess Lakshmi, the consort of Lord Jagannatha, visits Gundicha temple in search of Lord Jagannatha. Hera Panchami should not be confused with Panchami Tithi as Hera Panchami is celebrated on the fourth day after Ratha Yatra and usually observed on Shashthi Tithi.\n\nAfter resting eight days in Gundicha temple Lord Jagannatha returns to his main abode. This day is known asBahuda (बहुदा) YatraorReturn Yatraand is observed on the eighth day after Ratha Yatra on Dashami Tithi (if we do not have any skipped or leaped Tithi during Lords' stay in Gundicha temple). During Bahuda Yatra Lord makes a short stoppage atMausi Maa templewhich is dedicated toGoddess Ardhashini.\n\nIt should be noted that Lord Jagannatha returns to his main abode just beforeDevshayani Ekadashiwhen Lord Jagannatha goes to sleep for four months. Ratha Yatra is also known asPuri Car Festivalamong foreign visitors.\n\nIt should be noted that rituals of Ratha Yatra start much ahead of Ratha Yatra day. Approximately 18 days before of Ratha Yatra Lord Jagannatha, his brother Balabhadra and his sister Devi Subhadra are given famous ceremonial bath which is known asSnana Yatra. Snana Yatra day is observed on Purnima Tithi in Jyeshtha month which is popularly known asJyestha Purnima."

This day is known asBahuda (बहुदा) YatraorReturn Yatraand is observed on the eighth day after Ratha Yatra on Dashami Tithi (if we do not have any skipped or leaped Tithi during Lords' stay in Gundicha temple).

Ratha Yatra is also known asPuri Car Festivalamong foreign visitors.\n\nIt should be noted that rituals of Ratha Yatra start much ahead of Ratha Yatra day. Approximately 18 days before of Ratha Yatra Lord Jagannatha, his brother Balabhadra and his sister Devi Subhadra are given famous ceremonial bath which is known asSnana Yatra.

      "description": "According to the Hindu Panchang, the time when theLord Suryatransits from theKarka RashitoSimha Rashiis known as Simha Sankranti. This astronomical event occurs annually at the end of the month of Shravana or the beginning of Bhadrapada. The literal meaning of the word Sankranti is \"transition\" or \"change of position\". In some regions, Simha Sankranti is also referred to asSinghudi SankrantiorSinghada Parva. The period during which the Surya moves from one Rashi to another is called Sankranti. Simha Sankranti marks the occasion of the Surya entering the Simha Rashi and is considered highly auspicious for religious activities such as performing rituals, charity, penance, holy bathing and offerings Pitru Tarpan.\n\nAccording to Vedic astrology, the ruler of Simha Rashi is the Lord Surya. Hence, when the Surya enters Simha Rashi, it is said to be in its own house, i. E., Swagruhi, which amplifies its brilliance, influence and auspiciousness. For this reason, Simha Sankranti is considered a special time for Pitru Aradhana, performing charitable deeds, conducting Shraddha rituals, and offering prayers to the Lord Surya.\n\nGrihya Sutras, Dharma Shastras and various Puranas describe Sankranti periods as especially meritorious times. Notably, texts such as theNarada Purana, Matsya Purana, Skanda PuranaandVishnu Dharmasutrastate that religious acts performed during the Sankranti period yield a thousand times more merit compared to those performed at other times. Simha Sankranti is particularly significant for ancestral rituals. Any Shraddha, Tarpan, or Pind Daan performed during this time is believed to deeply satisfy the ancestors and bring prosperity to the lineage.\n\nOn this day, one should bathe early in the morning using water mixed with Ganga water and offer Arghya to the Lord Surya. After that, Tarpan should be performed for ancestors using sesame seeds and water, then offer food with Dakshina to a Brahmin. As per scriptures, anyone who donates food, clothing, umbrellas, footwear, cows, gold or land, etc., during Sankranti with devotion and within their means, earns merit for seven lifetimes.\n\nSimha Sankranti represents the inner strength and radiance of Lord Surya. As the Lord Surya enters its own sign Simha, it becomes a symbol of spiritual energy, penance, wisdom, brilliance, and courage. Therefore, this period is especially beneficial for spiritual seekers. Various Upanishads and Yogic texts mention that Surya worship, Gayatri Mantrachanting and Pranayama performed during Sankranti lead to spiritual accomplishment.\n\nThus, Simha Sankranti is not merely an astronomical event but a significant religious festival. Those who observe fasts, do chanting, take holy baths, offer Tarpan and engage in charity on this day with devotion are blessed both materially and spiritually."

Ganesha Visarjan continues throughout the night till the next morning.\n\nFew families perform Ganesha Visarjan on the 3rd, 5th or 7th day rather performing it on the 11th day as per their family tradition.

It is believed that Sharad Purnima is the only day in the year when the moon comes out with all sixteen Kala(s). In Hinduism, each human quality is associated with certain Kala and it is believed that the combination of sixteen different Kala(s) creates a perfect human personality. It wasLord Krishnawho was born with all sixteen Kala(s) and He was the complete incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Lord Ramawas born with only twelve Kala(s).\n\nHence, worshipping God Chandra on the day of Sharad Purnima is considered very significant. Newly wed women, who take pledge to doPurnimasi fastingfor the year, begin the fast from the day of Sharad Purnima. In Gujarat Sharad Purnima is more popularly known asSharad Poonam.\n\nOn this day not only Moon shines with all sixteen Kala(s) but also its rays have certain healing properties which nourish the body and the soul. It is also believed that the moon rays on the day of Sharad Purnima drip nectar. Hence to take advantage of this divine phenomenon, traditionally on the day of Sharad Purnima, Rice-Kheer a famous Indian sweet dish made of cow milk, rice and sugar, is prepared and left in moonlight for the whole night. In the morning, Rice-Kheer which is believed to be invigorated and fortified with the moonlight is consumed and distributed as Prasad in family members.\n\nIn Brij region, Sharad Purnima is also known asRaas Purnima(रास पूर्णिमा). It is believed that on the day of Sharad Purnima Lord Krishna performed Maha-Raas, the dance of divine love. On the night of Sharad Purnima, upon hearing the divine music of Krishna's flute, Gopis of Vrindavan sneaked away from their homes and families to the forest to dance with Krishna throughout the night. It was the day when Lord Krishna created several of Krishna(s) to accompany each Gopi. It is believed that Lord Krishna supernaturally stretched the night to the length of one night of Lord Brahma which was equivalent of billions of human years.\n\nIn many regions Sharad Purnima is known asKojagara Purnimawhen Kojagara Vrat is observed for the whole day. Kojagara Vrat is also known asKaumudi Vrat(कौमुदी व्रत)."

Depending on people and the region, the full moon day in Hindu calendar is also referred as Poornima, Poonam, Pournami and Pournimasi. In Vaishnava tradition Kartik month is known as Damodara month. Damodara is one of the names ofLord Krishna.\n\nIn Hindu calendar, Kartik is the holiest month among all lunar months. Many people take pledge to take holy dip before sunrise in Ganges and other holy rivers every day during the month of Kartik. The ritual of holy dip during Kartik month begins on the day ofSharad Purnimaand ends on Kartik Purnima.\n\nKartik Purnima is also very significant as many rituals and festivals culminate on the day of Kartik Purnima. The festivities of Kartika Purnima begin on the day ofPrabodhini Ekadashi. Ekadashi is the eleventh day and Purnima is the fifteenth day of Kartika month during Shukla Paksha. Hence Kartik Purnima festivities last for five days.\n\nTulasi-Vivah Utsavwhich begins on the day of Prabodhini Ekadashi culminates on the day of Kartik Purnima. As per religious books, Tulasi Vivahcan be performed on any suitable day between Ekadashi to Purnima in the month of Kartik. However, many people choose the day of Kartik Purnima to perform marriage rituals ofGoddess TulasiandLord Shaligram, an iconic representation of Lord Vishnu.\n\nBhishma Panchakafasting which begins on Ekadashi day ends on the day of Kartik Purnima. In Vaishnava tradition, the utmost importance is given to Bhishma Panchaka fasting during the last five days of Kartik month. The five days fasting is known as Bhishma Panchaka as well asVishnu Panchaka.\n\nVaikuntha Chaturdashifasting and Puja is performed on Chaturdashi Tithi i. E. One day before Kartik Purnima. It is believed that Lord Vishnu worshipped Lord Shiva on the day of Kartik Chaturdashi during Shukla Paksha and offered Him one thousand lotus flowers. Many Shiva temples organize special Puja during which Lord Vishnu is worshipped along with Lord Shiva. On the day of Vaikuntha Chaturdashi, a holy dip in Ganges before Sunrise at Manikarnika Ghat in Varanasi is considered very significant among devotees of Lord Shiva.\n\nDev Diwaliwhich is also known as Diwali of Gods is celebrated on the day of Kartik Purnima. It is believed thatLord Shivakilled demonTripurasuraon the day of Kartik Purnima. Hence Kartik Purnima is also known as Tripuri Purnima andTripurari Purnima. As per legends of Tripuri Purnima, Tripurasura defeated Gods and started ruling their kingdom. When Tripurasura was killed, Gods were overjoyed and celebrated the day of Kartik Purnima as the day of illuminations. Hence thousands of earthen lamps are lit at all temples as well as at the bank of river Ganga on the day of Kartik Purnima."

All Ekadashi fasting are dedicated toGoddess Ekadashiwho is one of the Shaktis of Lord Vishnu. Ekadashi was born out of Lord Vishnu to annihilate Demon Mur who intended to kill sleeping Lord Vishnu. Hence Goddess Ekadashi is one of the protective powers of Lord Vishnu.

Ghatasthapana is prohibited during Amavasya and night time.\n\nThe most auspicious or Shubh time to do Ghatasthapana is first one third of the day while Pratipada is prevailing. If due to some reasons this time is not available then Ghatasthapana can be done duringAbhijit Muhurta. It is advised to avoidNakshatra ChitraandVaidhriti Yogaduring Ghatasthapana but those are not prohibited. The most important factor to consider is that Ghatasthapana is done before Hindu midday while Pratipada is prevailing.\n\nDrikPanchang.

In other words we don't use Muhurta calculated for one city for any other city to make sure we consider all local factors like sunrise, sunset, midday, ascendant and last but not the least DST, if applicable.\n\nYou will find many sources which advise to takeChoghadiya Muhurtato do Ghatasthapana but our scriptures don't advise to take Choghadiya Muhurta.

During Shardiya Navratri Dvi-Svabhava LagnaKanyaprevails during sunrise and if suitable we take it for Ghatasthapana Muhurta.\n\nThe factors which are prohibited for Ghatasthapana are afternoon, night time and any time beyond sixteen Ghatis after sunrise.\n\nGhatasthapana is also known asKalash SthapanaorKalashsthapana.

Therefore, this month is considered especially important for the eldest child in the family. On the Purnima Tithi of this month, the Chandra travels through the Jyeshtha Nakshatra. The Purnima Tithi of Jyeshtha month is also known asVat Purnima. In many regions of India, married women observe a fast on Vat Purnima for the long life of their husbands. Besides this, the day is also considered very auspicious for offering Tarpan and Dana, i. E., donations in memory of ancestors. The day also holds special importance for worshippingLord VishnuandGoddess Lakshmi.\n\nJust like the Vat Savitri Vrat, women can observe a fast on the full moon day for good fortune and the growth of the family. Married women should take a vow for the fast, get fully adorned, and worship theVata Vriksha, i. E., banyan tree. They should offer flowers and sweet water at the root of the Vata Vriksha and tie a raw cotton thread around it while doing Parikrama. After the ritual, they should seek blessings from the elders in the family. The adornment items used for the ritual should be given to an elderly married woman. People who follow the general Purnima fast can also worship Lord Vishnu and Goddess Lakshmi under the Vat tree and chant Mantras.\n\nThis is a special type of fast, and following it properly is believed to fulfill all desires. It is described in theSkanda Purana. When the Jyeshtha Purnima falls on aTuesday, this fast is started. On that day, take a bath in the morning using mustard-mixed water, and worship theBilva Vriksha, i. E., Bael tree with Gandha and Pushpa etc. Eat only once during the day. If the food is seen by a dog, pig, or donkey, it should be discarded immediately. In this way, observe a fast on all full moon days for the next one year. On the final day of the fast, go near the Bilva tree and fill a container with aprroximatley 1 kg of grains such as barley, wheat, rice, and sesame. Cover another container with two pieces of cloth and install a gold idol ofUma-Maheshwarain it.

Currently it falls in month of June or July in Gregorian calendar.\n\nLord Jagannathais worshipped primarily in city of Puri at famous Jagannatha temple. Lord Jagannatha is considered a form of Lord Vishnu and also revered by the followers of Vaishnavism. Jagannatha literally means Lord of the Universe. Jagannatha temple is one of the four Hindu pilgrimage centers known asChar Dhampilgrimages that a Hindu is expected to make in one's lifetime. Lord Jagannatha is worshipped along with his brotherBalabhadraand his sister DeviSubhadra.\n\nRatha Yatra commemorates Lord Jagannatha's annual visit toGundicha (गुंडीचा) Mata temple. It is said that to honor the devotion ofQueen Gundicha, wife of the legendaryKing Indradyumna (इन्द्रद्युम्न)who built the Puri Jagannatha temple, the Lord Jagannatha, Balabhadra and Subhadra leave their regular abode in the main temple and spend a few days in this temple built by Gundicha in their honor.\n\nOne day before of Ratha Yatra, Gundicha Temple is cleaned by devotees of Lord Jagannatha. The ritual of cleaning Gundicha temple is known asGundicha Marjana (मार्जन)and is held one day before Ratha Yatra.\n\nThe fourth day after Ratha Yatra is celebrated asHera Panchami (हेरा पञ्चमी)whenGoddess Lakshmi, the consort of Lord Jagannatha, visits Gundicha temple in search of Lord Jagannatha. Hera Panchami should not be confused with Panchami Tithi as Hera Panchami is celebrated on the fourth day after Ratha Yatra and usually observed on Shashthi Tithi.\n\nAfter resting eight days in Gundicha temple Lord Jagannatha returns to his main abode. This day is known asBahuda (बहुदा) YatraorReturn Yatraand is observed on the eighth day after Ratha Yatra on Dashami Tithi (if we do not have any skipped or leaped Tithi during Lords' stay in Gundicha temple). During Bahuda Yatra Lord makes a short stoppage atMausi Maa templewhich is dedicated toGoddess Ardhashini.\n\nIt should be noted that Lord Jagannatha returns to his main abode just beforeDevshayani Ekadashiwhen Lord Jagannatha goes to sleep for four months. Ratha Yatra is also known asPuri Car Festivalamong foreign visitors.\n\nIt should be noted that rituals of Ratha Yatra start much ahead of Ratha Yatra day. Approximately 18 days before of Ratha Yatra Lord Jagannatha, his brother Balabhadra and his sister Devi Subhadra are given famous ceremonial bath which is known asSnana Yatra. Snana Yatra day is observed on Purnima Tithi in Jyeshtha month which is popularly known asJyestha Purnima."

This astronomical event occurs annually at the end of the month of Shravana or the beginning of Bhadrapada. The literal meaning of the word Sankranti is \"transition\" or \"change of position\". In some regions, Simha Sankranti is also referred to asSinghudi SankrantiorSinghada Parva. The period during which the Surya moves from one Rashi to another is called Sankranti. Simha Sankranti marks the occasion of the Surya entering the Simha Rashi and is considered highly auspicious for religious activities such as performing rituals, charity, penance, holy bathing and offerings Pitru Tarpan.\n\nAccording to Vedic astrology, the ruler of Simha Rashi is the Lord Surya. Hence, when the Surya enters Simha Rashi, it is said to be in its own house, i. E., Swagruhi, which amplifies its brilliance, influence and auspiciousness. For this reason, Simha Sankranti is considered a special time for Pitru Aradhana, performing charitable deeds, conducting Shraddha rituals, and offering prayers to the Lord Surya.\n\nGrihya Sutras, Dharma Shastras and various Puranas describe Sankranti periods as especially meritorious times. Notably, texts such as theNarada Purana, Matsya Purana, Skanda PuranaandVishnu Dharmasutrastate that religious acts performed during the Sankranti period yield a thousand times more merit compared to those performed at other times. Simha Sankranti is particularly significant for ancestral rituals. Any Shraddha, Tarpan, or Pind Daan performed during this time is believed to deeply satisfy the ancestors and bring prosperity to the lineage.\n\nOn this day, one should bathe early in the morning using water mixed with Ganga water and offer Arghya to the Lord Surya. After that, Tarpan should be performed for ancestors using sesame seeds and water, then offer food with Dakshina to a Brahmin. As per scriptures, anyone who donates food, clothing, umbrellas, footwear, cows, gold or land, etc., during Sankranti with devotion and within their means, earns merit for seven lifetimes.\n\nSimha Sankranti represents the inner strength and radiance of Lord Surya. As the Lord Surya enters its own sign Simha, it becomes a symbol of spiritual energy, penance, wisdom, brilliance, and courage. Therefore, this period is especially beneficial for spiritual seekers. Various Upanishads and Yogic texts mention that Surya worship, Gayatri Mantrachanting and Pranayama performed during Sankranti lead to spiritual accomplishment.\n\nThus, Simha Sankranti is not merely an astronomical event but a significant religious festival. Those who observe fasts, do chanting, take holy baths, offer Tarpan and engage in charity on this day with devotion are blessed both materially and spiritually."

Hence, one name of this fast is also Kaumudi Vrat. According to Skandapuran, Kojagara Vrat is the best fast, by observing which even an ordinary being attains the highest position and gets opulence, health and children in this birth and in other births also.\n\nThe day when Purnima is Nishithvyapini, that day is considered best for Kojagara puja.\n\nKojagara Puja Purnima is more famously known asSharad Purnimain most parts of India. However, most people in Indiaworship Goddess Lakshmion Amavasya Tithi duringDiwali.\n\nKojagara Puja Mahatamya is described by Valakhilya Rishi -\n\nThe disciples of sage Valakhilya asked, describe the Upangvratas of Kartik, by observing which fast of Kartika gets completed. Valakhilya said that, on the Shuklapaksha Purnima of Ashwin month, one should worship Lakshmi Ji with devotion at night. On this day, Goddess Lakshmi is pleased by drinkingcoconut waterand playing the game ofChausar. On the night of Kojagara Puja, Goddess Lakshmi comes to visit the earth to give boons to the devotees who are doing Jagrana. All the devotees who are surrounded by poverty must observe this fast because a poor Brahmin named Valit also became very rich by observing this fast.\n\nThe sages asked, who was Valit and where did he get the money from? Please describe this story in detail.\n\nA Brahmin named Valit lived in the country of Magadha. Although he was rich in much knowledge and used to perform Sandhya Snana daily, but financially he was very poor. If someone came to donate something to him at home, he would accept it, otherwise he would not go to ask for anything from anyone.\n\nTo read in detail, please click onKojagara Vrat Katha."

It is believed that Sharad Purnima is the only day in the year when the moon comes out with all sixteen Kala(s). In Hinduism, each human quality is associated with certain Kala and it is believed that the combination of sixteen different Kala(s) creates a perfect human personality. It wasLord Krishnawho was born with all sixteen Kala(s) and He was the complete incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Lord Ramawas born with only twelve Kala(s).\n\nHence, worshipping God Chandra on the day of Sharad Purnima is considered very significant. Newly wed women, who take pledge to doPurnimasi fastingfor the year, begin the fast from the day of Sharad Purnima. In Gujarat Sharad Purnima is more popularly known asSharad Poonam.\n\nOn this day not only Moon shines with all sixteen Kala(s) but also its rays have certain healing properties which nourish the body and the soul. It is also believed that the moon rays on the day of Sharad Purnima drip nectar. Hence to take advantage of this divine phenomenon, traditionally on the day of Sharad Purnima, Rice-Kheer a famous Indian sweet dish made of cow milk, rice and sugar, is prepared and left in moonlight for the whole night. In the morning, Rice-Kheer which is believed to be invigorated and fortified with the moonlight is consumed and distributed as Prasad in family members.\n\nIn Brij region, Sharad Purnima is also known asRaas Purnima(रास पूर्णिमा). It is believed that on the day of Sharad Purnima Lord Krishna performed Maha-Raas, the dance of divine love. On the night of Sharad Purnima, upon hearing the divine music of Krishna's flute, Gopis of Vrindavan sneaked away from their homes and families to the forest to dance with Krishna throughout the night. It was the day when Lord Krishna created several of Krishna(s) to accompany each Gopi. It is believed that Lord Krishna supernaturally stretched the night to the length of one night of Lord Brahma which was equivalent of billions of human years.\n\nIn many regions Sharad Purnima is known asKojagara Purnimawhen Kojagara Vrat is observed for the whole day. Kojagara Vrat is also known asKaumudi Vrat(कौमुदी व्रत)."

Depending on people and the region, the full moon day in Hindu calendar is also referred as Poornima, Poonam, Pournami and Pournimasi. In Vaishnava tradition Kartik month is known as Damodara month. Damodara is one of the names ofLord Krishna.\n\nIn Hindu calendar, Kartik is the holiest month among all lunar months. Many people take pledge to take holy dip before sunrise in Ganges and other holy rivers every day during the month of Kartik. The ritual of holy dip during Kartik month begins on the day ofSharad Purnimaand ends on Kartik Purnima.\n\nKartik Purnima is also very significant as many rituals and festivals culminate on the day of Kartik Purnima. The festivities of Kartika Purnima begin on the day ofPrabodhini Ekadashi. Ekadashi is the eleventh day and Purnima is the fifteenth day of Kartika month during Shukla Paksha. Hence Kartik Purnima festivities last for five days.\n\nTulasi-Vivah Utsavwhich begins on the day of Prabodhini Ekadashi culminates on the day of Kartik Purnima. As per religious books, Tulasi Vivahcan be performed on any suitable day between Ekadashi to Purnima in the month of Kartik. However, many people choose the day of Kartik Purnima to perform marriage rituals ofGoddess TulasiandLord Shaligram, an iconic representation of Lord Vishnu.\n\nBhishma Panchakafasting which begins on Ekadashi day ends on the day of Kartik Purnima. In Vaishnava tradition, the utmost importance is given to Bhishma Panchaka fasting during the last five days of Kartik month. The five days fasting is known as Bhishma Panchaka as well asVishnu Panchaka.\n\nVaikuntha Chaturdashifasting and Puja is performed on Chaturdashi Tithi i. E. One day before Kartik Purnima. It is believed that Lord Vishnu worshipped Lord Shiva on the day of Kartik Chaturdashi during Shukla Paksha and offered Him one thousand lotus flowers. Many Shiva temples organize special Puja during which Lord Vishnu is worshipped along with Lord Shiva. On the day of Vaikuntha Chaturdashi, a holy dip in Ganges before Sunrise at Manikarnika Ghat in Varanasi is considered very significant among devotees of Lord Shiva.\n\nDev Diwaliwhich is also known as Diwali of Gods is celebrated on the day of Kartik Purnima. It is believed thatLord Shivakilled demonTripurasuraon the day of Kartik Purnima. Hence Kartik Purnima is also known as Tripuri Purnima andTripurari Purnima. As per legends of Tripuri Purnima, Tripurasura defeated Gods and started ruling their kingdom. When Tripurasura was killed, Gods were overjoyed and celebrated the day of Kartik Purnima as the day of illuminations. Hence thousands of earthen lamps are lit at all temples as well as at the bank of river Ganga on the day of Kartik Purnima."

All Ekadashi fasting are dedicated toGoddess Ekadashiwho is one of the Shaktis of Lord Vishnu. Ekadashi was born out of Lord Vishnu to annihilate Demon Mur who intended to kill sleeping Lord Vishnu. Hence Goddess Ekadashi is one of the protective powers of Lord Vishnu.

Ghatasthapana is prohibited during Amavasya and night time.\n\nThe most auspicious or Shubh time to do Ghatasthapana is first one third of the day while Pratipada is prevailing. If due to some reasons this time is not available then Ghatasthapana can be done duringAbhijit Muhurta. It is advised to avoidNakshatra ChitraandVaidhriti Yogaduring Ghatasthapana but those are not prohibited.

During Shardiya Navratri Dvi-Svabhava LagnaKanyaprevails during sunrise and if suitable we take it for Ghatasthapana Muhurta.\n\nThe factors which are prohibited for Ghatasthapana are afternoon, night time and any time beyond sixteen Ghatis after sunrise.\n\nGhatasthapana is also known asKalash SthapanaorKalashsthapana.

Therefore, this month is considered especially important for the eldest child in the family. On the Purnima Tithi of this month, the Chandra travels through the Jyeshtha Nakshatra. The Purnima Tithi of Jyeshtha month is also known asVat Purnima. In many regions of India, married women observe a fast on Vat Purnima for the long life of their husbands. Besides this, the day is also considered very auspicious for offering Tarpan and Dana, i. E., donations in memory of ancestors. The day also holds special importance for worshippingLord VishnuandGoddess Lakshmi.\n\nJust like the Vat Savitri Vrat, women can observe a fast on the full moon day for good fortune and the growth of the family. Married women should take a vow for the fast, get fully adorned, and worship theVata Vriksha, i. E., banyan tree. They should offer flowers and sweet water at the root of the Vata Vriksha and tie a raw cotton thread around it while doing Parikrama. After the ritual, they should seek blessings from the elders in the family. The adornment items used for the ritual should be given to an elderly married woman. People who follow the general Purnima fast can also worship Lord Vishnu and Goddess Lakshmi under the Vat tree and chant Mantras.\n\nThis is a special type of fast, and following it properly is believed to fulfill all desires. It is described in theSkanda Purana. When the Jyeshtha Purnima falls on aTuesday, this fast is started. On that day, take a bath in the morning using mustard-mixed water, and worship theBilva Vriksha, i. E., Bael tree with Gandha and Pushpa etc. Eat only once during the day. If the food is seen by a dog, pig, or donkey, it should be discarded immediately. In this way, observe a fast on all full moon days for the next one year. On the final day of the fast, go near the Bilva tree and fill a container with aprroximatley 1 kg of grains such as barley, wheat, rice, and sesame. Cover another container with two pieces of cloth and install a gold idol ofUma-Maheshwarain it.

Lord Jagannatha is worshipped along with his brotherBalabhadraand his sister DeviSubhadra.\n\nRatha Yatra commemorates Lord Jagannatha's annual visit toGundicha (गुंडीचा) Mata temple. It is said that to honor the devotion ofQueen Gundicha, wife of the legendaryKing Indradyumna (इन्द्रद्युम्न)who built the Puri Jagannatha temple, the Lord Jagannatha, Balabhadra and Subhadra leave their regular abode in the main temple and spend a few days in this temple built by Gundicha in their honor.\n\nOne day before of Ratha Yatra, Gundicha Temple is cleaned by devotees of Lord Jagannatha. The ritual of cleaning Gundicha temple is known asGundicha Marjana (मार्जन)and is held one day before Ratha Yatra.\n\nThe fourth day after Ratha Yatra is celebrated asHera Panchami (हेरा पञ्चमी)whenGoddess Lakshmi, the consort of Lord Jagannatha, visits Gundicha temple in search of Lord Jagannatha. Hera Panchami should not be confused with Panchami Tithi as Hera Panchami is celebrated on the fourth day after Ratha Yatra and usually observed on Shashthi Tithi.\n\nAfter resting eight days in Gundicha temple Lord Jagannatha returns to his main abode. This day is known asBahuda (बहुदा) YatraorReturn Yatraand is observed on the eighth day after Ratha Yatra on Dashami Tithi (if we do not have any skipped or leaped Tithi during Lords' stay in Gundicha temple). During Bahuda Yatra Lord makes a short stoppage atMausi Maa templewhich is dedicated toGoddess Ardhashini.\n\nIt should be noted that Lord Jagannatha returns to his main abode just beforeDevshayani Ekadashiwhen Lord Jagannatha goes to sleep for four months. Ratha Yatra is also known asPuri Car Festivalamong foreign visitors.\n\nIt should be noted that rituals of Ratha Yatra start much ahead of Ratha Yatra day. Approximately 18 days before of Ratha Yatra Lord Jagannatha, his brother Balabhadra and his sister Devi Subhadra are given famous ceremonial bath which is known asSnana Yatra.

Nag Panchami is one of those significant days and it observed on Shukla Paksha Panchami during Shravana month.\n\nIt is believed that any Puja offered to snakes would reach to the serpent Gods. Hence people worship live snakes on the day as representative of serpents Gods who are revered and worshipped in Hinduism. Although there are several serpent Gods, following twelve are worshipped during Nag Panchami Puja -\n\nसर्वे नागाः प्रीयन्तां मे ये केचित् पृथ्वीतले।ये च हेलिमरीचिस्था येऽन्तरे दिवि संस्थिताः॥ये नदीषु महानागा ये सरस्वतिगामिनः।ये च वापीतडगेषु तेषु सर्वेषु वै नमः॥\n\nMantra Translation- May the snakes who are staying in this world, sky, heaven, sun-rays, lakes, wells, ponds etc. Bless us and we all salute them.\n\nअनन्तं वासुकिं शेषं पद्मनाभं च कम्बलम्।शङ्ख पालं धृतराष्ट्रं तक्षकं कालियं तथा॥एतानि नव नामानि नागानां च महात्मनाम्।सायङ्काले पठेन्नित्यं प्रातःकाले विशेषतः।तस्य विषभयं नास्ति सर्वत्र विजयी भवेत्॥\n\nMantra Translation- The names of nine Nag Devtas are Ananta, Vasuki, Shesha, Padmanabha, Kambala, Shankhapala, Dhritarashtra, Takshaka and Kaliya. If chanted regularly every day in the morning, will keep you protected from all evils and make you victorious in life.\n\nSome people keep fast one day before Nag Panchami and fasting day before Nag Panchami is known as Nag Chaturthi or Nagul Chavithi.

Varalakshmi, who is the consort ofLord Vishnu, is one of the forms ofGoddess Mahalakshmi. Varalakshmi was incarnated from the milky ocean, popularly known asKshir Sagar. She is described as having the complexion of milky ocean and adorns similar color clothes.\n\nIt is believed that theVaralakshmiform of the goddess bestows boons and fulfills all desires of her devotees. Hence this form of the goddess is known asVara+Lakshmii. E. Goddess Lakshmi who bestows boons.\n\nThe Varalakshmi fasting is observed on the last Friday during Shravana Shukla Paksha and falls just few days ahead ofRakhiand Shravana Purnima.\n\nVaralakshmi Vrat is suggested not only for women but also for men. However, in Andhra, Telangana and Maharashtra regions, Varalakshmi fasting in mainly performed by married women only. The Varalakshmi fasting is performed with the desire of worldly pleasures and it includes children, spouse, luxury and all sorts of earthly pleasures.\n\nVaralakshmi Vratam is very popular fasting and Puja day in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. In these states, Varalakshmi Puja is performed mostly by married women for the well-being of husband and the other family members.

The eight Goddesses of Wealth (Sri), Earth (Bhu), Learning (Saraswati), Love (Priti), Fame (Kirti), Peace (Shanti), Pleasure (Tushti) and Strength (Pushti).\n\nHowever, in North Indian states Varalakshmi Puja is not as popular as those of South Indian states. Varalakshmi Vratam is one of the most appropriate days to propitiate and to seek blessings of the Goddess Lakshmi.\n\nAs perElectional Astrology, the most appropriate time to worship Goddess Lakshmi is during fixed Lagna. It is believed that if Lakshmi Puja is done during fixed Lagna would bestow long-lasting prosperity.\n\nHence we have given four Puja timing in a day when fixed Lagna prevails. Any suitable time can be chosen for Varalakshmi Puja. However, evening time which overlaps with Pradosh is considered the most appropriate to worship Goddess Lakshmi.\n\nThe Puja steps in Varalakshmi Puja Vidhi are similar toMaha Lakshmi Puja during Diwali.

Married women should take a vow for the fast, get fully adorned, and worship theVata Vriksha, i. E., banyan tree. They should offer flowers and sweet water at the root of the Vata Vriksha and tie a raw cotton thread around it while doing Parikrama. After the ritual, they should seek blessings from the elders in the family. The adornment items used for the ritual should be given to an elderly married woman. People who follow the general Purnima fast can also worship Lord Vishnu and Goddess Lakshmi under the Vat tree and chant Mantras.\n\nThis is a special type of fast, and following it properly is believed to fulfill all desires. It is described in theSkanda Purana. When the Jyeshtha Purnima falls on aTuesday, this fast is started. On that day, take a bath in the morning using mustard-mixed water, and worship theBilva Vriksha, i. E., Bael tree with Gandha and Pushpa etc. Eat only once during the day. If the food is seen by a dog, pig, or donkey, it should be discarded immediately. In this way, observe a fast on all full moon days for the next one year.

This day is known asBahuda (बहुदा) YatraorReturn Yatraand is observed on the eighth day after Ratha Yatra on Dashami Tithi (if we do not have any skipped or leaped Tithi during Lords' stay in Gundicha temple).

This astronomical event occurs annually at the end of the month of Shravana or the beginning of Bhadrapada. The literal meaning of the word Sankranti is \"transition\" or \"change of position\". In some regions, Simha Sankranti is also referred to asSinghudi SankrantiorSinghada Parva. The period during which the Surya moves from one Rashi to another is called Sankranti. Simha Sankranti marks the occasion of the Surya entering the Simha Rashi and is considered highly auspicious for religious activities such as performing rituals, charity, penance, holy bathing and offerings Pitru Tarpan.\n\nAccording to Vedic astrology, the ruler of Simha Rashi is the Lord Surya. Hence, when the Surya enters Simha Rashi, it is said to be in its own house, i. E., Swagruhi, which amplifies its brilliance, influence and auspiciousness. For this reason, Simha Sankranti is considered a special time for Pitru Aradhana, performing charitable deeds, conducting Shraddha rituals, and offering prayers to the Lord Surya.\n\nGrihya Sutras, Dharma Shastras and various Puranas describe Sankranti periods as especially meritorious times. Notably, texts such as theNarada Purana, Matsya Purana, Skanda PuranaandVishnu Dharmasutrastate that religious acts performed during the Sankranti period yield a thousand times more merit compared to those performed at other times. Simha Sankranti is particularly significant for ancestral rituals. Any Shraddha, Tarpan, or Pind Daan performed during this time is believed to deeply satisfy the ancestors and bring prosperity to the lineage.\n\nOn this day, one should bathe early in the morning using water mixed with Ganga water and offer Arghya to the Lord Surya. After that, Tarpan should be performed for ancestors using sesame seeds and water, then offer food with Dakshina to a Brahmin. As per scriptures, anyone who donates food, clothing, umbrellas, footwear, cows, gold or land, etc., during Sankranti with devotion and within their means, earns merit for seven lifetimes.\n\nSimha Sankranti represents the inner strength and radiance of Lord Surya. As the Lord Surya enters its own sign Simha, it becomes a symbol of spiritual energy, penance, wisdom, brilliance, and courage. Therefore, this period is especially beneficial for spiritual seekers. Various Upanishads and Yogic texts mention that Surya worship, Gayatri Mantrachanting and Pranayama performed during Sankranti lead to spiritual accomplishment.\n\nThus, Simha Sankranti is not merely an astronomical event but a significant religious festival. Those who observe fasts, do chanting, take holy baths, offer Tarpan and engage in charity on this day with devotion are blessed both materially and spiritually."

It is believed that Parashurama was born duringPradosh Kalaand hence the day when Tritiya prevails during Pradosh Kala is considered for Parashurama Jayanti celebrations. The purpose of the sixth incarnation of Lord Vishnu is to relieve the Earth's burden by exterminating the sinful, destructive and irreligious monarchs that pillaged its resources and neglected their duties as kings.\n\nAccording to Hindu belief unlike all other avatars Parashurama still lives on the Earth. Therefore, unlikeRamaandKrishna, Parashurama is not worshipped. In South India, at the holy placePajakanearUdupi, one major temple exists which commemorates Parashurama. There are many temples at the western coast of India which are dedicated to Lord Parashurama.\n\nTheKalki Puranastates that Parashurama will be the martial guru ofShri Kalki, the 10thand final Avatar of Lord Vishnu. It is not the first time that 6thAvatar of Lord Vishnu will meet another Avatar. According toRamayana, Parashurama came to the betrothal ceremony ofSitaand Lord Rama and met the 7thAvatar of Lord Vishnu.\n\nTo read detailed description aboutParashurama Avataraof Lord Vishnu, please visit -Parashurama Incarnation."

Lord Jagannatha is worshipped along with his brotherBalabhadraand his sister DeviSubhadra.\n\nRatha Yatra commemorates Lord Jagannatha's annual visit toGundicha (गुंडीचा) Mata temple. It is said that to honor the devotion ofQueen Gundicha, wife of the legendaryKing Indradyumna (इन्द्रद्युम्न)who built the Puri Jagannatha temple, the Lord Jagannatha, Balabhadra and Subhadra leave their regular abode in the main temple and spend a few days in this temple built by Gundicha in their honor.\n\nOne day before of Ratha Yatra, Gundicha Temple is cleaned by devotees of Lord Jagannatha.

This day is known asBahuda (बहुदा) YatraorReturn Yatraand is observed on the eighth day after Ratha Yatra on Dashami Tithi (if we do not have any skipped or leaped Tithi during Lords' stay in Gundicha temple). During Bahuda Yatra Lord makes a short stoppage atMausi Maa templewhich is dedicated toGoddess Ardhashini.\n\nIt should be noted that Lord Jagannatha returns to his main abode just beforeDevshayani Ekadashiwhen Lord Jagannatha goes to sleep for four months. Ratha Yatra is also known asPuri Car Festivalamong foreign visitors.\n\nIt should be noted that rituals of Ratha Yatra start much ahead of Ratha Yatra day. Approximately 18 days before of Ratha Yatra Lord Jagannatha, his brother Balabhadra and his sister Devi Subhadra are given famous ceremonial bath which is known asSnana Yatra. Snana Yatra day is observed on Purnima Tithi in Jyeshtha month which is popularly known asJyestha Purnima."

This astronomical event occurs annually at the end of the month of Shravana or the beginning of Bhadrapada. The literal meaning of the word Sankranti is \"transition\" or \"change of position\". In some regions, Simha Sankranti is also referred to asSinghudi SankrantiorSinghada Parva. The period during which the Surya moves from one Rashi to another is called Sankranti. Simha Sankranti marks the occasion of the Surya entering the Simha Rashi and is considered highly auspicious for religious activities such as performing rituals, charity, penance, holy bathing and offerings Pitru Tarpan.\n\nAccording to Vedic astrology, the ruler of Simha Rashi is the Lord Surya. Hence, when the Surya enters Simha Rashi, it is said to be in its own house, i. E., Swagruhi, which amplifies its brilliance, influence and auspiciousness. For this reason, Simha Sankranti is considered a special time for Pitru Aradhana, performing charitable deeds, conducting Shraddha rituals, and offering prayers to the Lord Surya.\n\nGrihya Sutras, Dharma Shastras and various Puranas describe Sankranti periods as especially meritorious times. Notably, texts such as theNarada Purana, Matsya Purana, Skanda PuranaandVishnu Dharmasutrastate that religious acts performed during the Sankranti period yield a thousand times more merit compared to those performed at other times. Simha Sankranti is particularly significant for ancestral rituals. Any Shraddha, Tarpan, or Pind Daan performed during this time is believed to deeply satisfy the ancestors and bring prosperity to the lineage.\n\nOn this day, one should bathe early in the morning using water mixed with Ganga water and offer Arghya to the Lord Surya. After that, Tarpan should be performed for ancestors using sesame seeds and water, then offer food with Dakshina to a Brahmin. As per scriptures, anyone who donates food, clothing, umbrellas, footwear, cows, gold or land, etc., during Sankranti with devotion and within their means, earns merit for seven lifetimes.\n\nSimha Sankranti represents the inner strength and radiance of Lord Surya. As the Lord Surya enters its own sign Simha, it becomes a symbol of spiritual energy, penance, wisdom, brilliance, and courage. Therefore, this period is especially beneficial for spiritual seekers. Various Upanishads and Yogic texts mention that Surya worship, Gayatri Mantrachanting and Pranayama performed during Sankranti lead to spiritual accomplishment.\n\nThus, Simha Sankranti is not merely an astronomical event but a significant religious festival. Those who observe fasts, do chanting, take holy baths, offer Tarpan and engage in charity on this day with devotion are blessed both materially and spiritually."

All nine forms of Goddess Durga are worshipped during Maha Ashtami Puja.\n\nYoung unmarried girls, being treated as Goddess Durga itself, are also worshipped on Maha Ashtami. Worshipping of young girls during Durga Puja is known as Kumari Puja. In many regionsKumari Pujais done during all nine days ofDurga Navratri. Kumari Puja on a single day during Durga Puja is preferred on Maha Ashtami.\n\nThe legendarySandhi Pujais also falls on Maha Ashtami. The time window of the last 24 minutes of Ashtami Tithi and the first 24 minutes of Navami Tithi is known asSandhi Timeor the holy juncture during Durga Puja. Sandhi time is considered the most auspicious time during whole Durga Puja. Sandhi Puja is the culmination point and the most important ritual of Durga Puja. It is customary to performBalidanor animal sacrifice at this sacred juncture. Devotees who abstain from animal sacrifice perform symbolic Bali with vegetables like banana, cucumber or pumpkin. For Brahmins any type of animal sacrifice is prohibited by scriptures and Brahmin community does only symbolic Bali. Even the famousBelur Math in West Bengaldoes symbolic Bali with banana during Sandhi Puja. It is customary to light 108 earthen lamps during Sandhi Kaal."

Depending on people and the region, the full moon day in Hindu calendar is also referred as Poornima, Poonam, Pournami and Pournimasi. In Vaishnava tradition Kartik month is known as Damodara month. Damodara is one of the names ofLord Krishna.\n\nIn Hindu calendar, Kartik is the holiest month among all lunar months. Many people take pledge to take holy dip before sunrise in Ganges and other holy rivers every day during the month of Kartik. The ritual of holy dip during Kartik month begins on the day ofSharad Purnimaand ends on Kartik Purnima.\n\nKartik Purnima is also very significant as many rituals and festivals culminate on the day of Kartik Purnima. The festivities of Kartika Purnima begin on the day ofPrabodhini Ekadashi. Ekadashi is the eleventh day and Purnima is the fifteenth day of Kartika month during Shukla Paksha. Hence Kartik Purnima festivities last for five days.\n\nTulasi-Vivah Utsavwhich begins on the day of Prabodhini Ekadashi culminates on the day of Kartik Purnima. As per religious books, Tulasi Vivahcan be performed on any suitable day between Ekadashi to Purnima in the month of Kartik. However, many people choose the day of Kartik Purnima to perform marriage rituals ofGoddess TulasiandLord Shaligram, an iconic representation of Lord Vishnu.\n\nBhishma Panchakafasting which begins on Ekadashi day ends on the day of Kartik Purnima. In Vaishnava tradition, the utmost importance is given to Bhishma Panchaka fasting during the last five days of Kartik month. The five days fasting is known as Bhishma Panchaka as well asVishnu Panchaka.\n\nVaikuntha Chaturdashifasting and Puja is performed on Chaturdashi Tithi i. E. One day before Kartik Purnima. It is believed that Lord Vishnu worshipped Lord Shiva on the day of Kartik Chaturdashi during Shukla Paksha and offered Him one thousand lotus flowers. Many Shiva temples organize special Puja during which Lord Vishnu is worshipped along with Lord Shiva. On the day of Vaikuntha Chaturdashi, a holy dip in Ganges before Sunrise at Manikarnika Ghat in Varanasi is considered very significant among devotees of Lord Shiva.\n\nDev Diwaliwhich is also known as Diwali of Gods is celebrated on the day of Kartik Purnima. It is believed thatLord Shivakilled demonTripurasuraon the day of Kartik Purnima. Hence Kartik Purnima is also known as Tripuri Purnima andTripurari Purnima. As per legends of Tripuri Purnima, Tripurasura defeated Gods and started ruling their kingdom. When Tripurasura was killed, Gods were overjoyed and celebrated the day of Kartik Purnima as the day of illuminations. Hence thousands of earthen lamps are lit at all temples as well as at the bank of river Ganga on the day of Kartik Purnima."

Lord Jagannatha is worshipped along with his brotherBalabhadraand his sister DeviSubhadra.\n\nRatha Yatra commemorates Lord Jagannatha's annual visit toGundicha (गुंडीचा) Mata temple. It is said that to honor the devotion ofQueen Gundicha, wife of the legendaryKing Indradyumna (इन्द्रद्युम्न)who built the Puri Jagannatha temple, the Lord Jagannatha, Balabhadra and Subhadra leave their regular abode in the main temple and spend a few days in this temple built by Gundicha in their honor.\n\nOne day before of Ratha Yatra, Gundicha Temple is cleaned by devotees of Lord Jagannatha. The ritual of cleaning Gundicha temple is known asGundicha Marjana (मार्जन)and is held one day before Ratha Yatra.\n\nThe fourth day after Ratha Yatra is celebrated asHera Panchami (हेरा पञ्चमी)whenGoddess Lakshmi, the consort of Lord Jagannatha, visits Gundicha temple in search of Lord Jagannatha.

This day is known asBahuda (बहुदा) YatraorReturn Yatraand is observed on the eighth day after Ratha Yatra on Dashami Tithi (if we do not have any skipped or leaped Tithi during Lords' stay in Gundicha temple). During Bahuda Yatra Lord makes a short stoppage atMausi Maa templewhich is dedicated toGoddess Ardhashini.\n\nIt should be noted that Lord Jagannatha returns to his main abode just beforeDevshayani Ekadashiwhen Lord Jagannatha goes to sleep for four months. Ratha Yatra is also known asPuri Car Festivalamong foreign visitors.\n\nIt should be noted that rituals of Ratha Yatra start much ahead of Ratha Yatra day. Approximately 18 days before of Ratha Yatra Lord Jagannatha, his brother Balabhadra and his sister Devi Subhadra are given famous ceremonial bath which is known asSnana Yatra. Snana Yatra day is observed on Purnima Tithi in Jyeshtha month which is popularly known asJyestha Purnima."

      "description": "According to the Hindu Panchang, the time when theLord Suryatransits from theKarka RashitoSimha Rashiis known as Simha Sankranti. This astronomical event occurs annually at the end of the month of Shravana or the beginning of Bhadrapada. The literal meaning of the word Sankranti is \"transition\" or \"change of position\". In some regions, Simha Sankranti is also referred to asSinghudi SankrantiorSinghada Parva. The period during which the Surya moves from one Rashi to another is called Sankranti. Simha Sankranti marks the occasion of the Surya entering the Simha Rashi and is considered highly auspicious for religious activities such as performing rituals, charity, penance, holy bathing and offerings Pitru Tarpan.\n\nAccording to Vedic astrology, the ruler of Simha Rashi is the Lord Surya. Hence, when the Surya enters Simha Rashi, it is said to be in its own house, i. E., Swagruhi, which amplifies its brilliance, influence and auspiciousness. For this reason, Simha Sankranti is considered a special time for Pitru Aradhana, performing charitable deeds, conducting Shraddha rituals, and offering prayers to the Lord Surya.\n\nGrihya Sutras, Dharma Shastras and various Puranas describe Sankranti periods as especially meritorious times. Notably, texts such as theNarada Purana, Matsya Purana, Skanda PuranaandVishnu Dharmasutrastate that religious acts performed during the Sankranti period yield a thousand times more merit compared to those performed at other times. Simha Sankranti is particularly significant for ancestral rituals. Any Shraddha, Tarpan, or Pind Daan performed during this time is believed to deeply satisfy the ancestors and bring prosperity to the lineage.\n\nOn this day, one should bathe early in the morning using water mixed with Ganga water and offer Arghya to the Lord Surya. After that, Tarpan should be performed for ancestors using sesame seeds and water, then offer food with Dakshina to a Brahmin. As per scriptures, anyone who donates food, clothing, umbrellas, footwear, cows, gold or land, etc., during Sankranti with devotion and within their means, earns merit for seven lifetimes.\n\nSimha Sankranti represents the inner strength and radiance of Lord Surya. As the Lord Surya enters its own sign Simha, it becomes a symbol of spiritual energy, penance, wisdom, brilliance, and courage. Therefore, this period is especially beneficial for spiritual seekers. Various Upanishads and Yogic texts mention that Surya worship, Gayatri Mantrachanting and Pranayama performed during Sankranti lead to spiritual accomplishment.\n\nThus, Simha Sankranti is not merely an astronomical event but a significant religious festival. Those who observe fasts, do chanting, take holy baths, offer Tarpan and engage in charity on this day with devotion are blessed both materially and spiritually."

This duration of forty Ghatis is known as Punya Kaal. Sankranti activities, like taking bath, offering Naivedhya (food offered to deity) to Lord Surya, offering charity or Dakshina, performing Shraddha rituals and breaking fast or Parana, should be done during Punya Kaal.\n\nIf Makar Sankranti happens after Sunset then all Punya Kaal activities are postponed till next day Sunrise. Hence all Punya Kaal activities should be done in day time.\n\nDrikPanchang. Comsuggests Sankranti Muhurta which falls between Makar Sankranti moment and 40 Ghatis from it. We list this time asPunya Kaal Muhurta. Our holy scriptures suggest that 5 Ghatis duration after Sunrise (if Sankranti happens after Sunset on previous day) and 1 Ghati duration after Sankranti moment (if Sankranti happens in day time) are highly auspicious. If this Muhurta is available we list it asMahapunya Kaal Muhurta. Mahapunya Kaal Muhurta, if available, should be preferred over Punya Kaal Muhurta.\n\nIn Tamil Nadu Makar Sankranti or Sankranthi is known asPongal. In Gujarat and Rajasthan Makar Sankranti is known asUttarayana. In Haryana and Punjab Makar Sankranti is known asMaghi.\n\nSankranti Punya Kaal is different for all cities.

Therefore, this month is considered especially important for the eldest child in the family. On the Purnima Tithi of this month, the Chandra travels through the Jyeshtha Nakshatra. The Purnima Tithi of Jyeshtha month is also known asVat Purnima. In many regions of India, married women observe a fast on Vat Purnima for the long life of their husbands.

Married women should take a vow for the fast, get fully adorned, and worship theVata Vriksha, i. E., banyan tree. They should offer flowers and sweet water at the root of the Vata Vriksha and tie a raw cotton thread around it while doing Parikrama. After the ritual, they should seek blessings from the elders in the family. The adornment items used for the ritual should be given to an elderly married woman. People who follow the general Purnima fast can also worship Lord Vishnu and Goddess Lakshmi under the Vat tree and chant Mantras.\n\nThis is a special type of fast, and following it properly is believed to fulfill all desires. It is described in theSkanda Purana. When the Jyeshtha Purnima falls on aTuesday, this fast is started. On that day, take a bath in the morning using mustard-mixed water, and worship theBilva Vriksha, i. E., Bael tree with Gandha and Pushpa etc. Eat only once during the day. If the food is seen by a dog, pig, or donkey, it should be discarded immediately. In this way, observe a fast on all full moon days for the next one year.

      "description": "According to the Hindu Panchang, the time when theLord Suryatransits from theKarka RashitoSimha Rashiis known as Simha Sankranti. This astronomical event occurs annually at the end of the month of Shravana or the beginning of Bhadrapada. The literal meaning of the word Sankranti is \"transition\" or \"change of position\". In some regions, Simha Sankranti is also referred to asSinghudi SankrantiorSinghada Parva. The period during which the Surya moves from one Rashi to another is called Sankranti. Simha Sankranti marks the occasion of the Surya entering the Simha Rashi and is considered highly auspicious for religious activities such as performing rituals, charity, penance, holy bathing and offerings Pitru Tarpan.\n\nAccording to Vedic astrology, the ruler of Simha Rashi is the Lord Surya. Hence, when the Surya enters Simha Rashi, it is said to be in its own house, i. E., Swagruhi, which amplifies its brilliance, influence and auspiciousness. For this reason, Simha Sankranti is considered a special time for Pitru Aradhana, performing charitable deeds, conducting Shraddha rituals, and offering prayers to the Lord Surya.\n\nGrihya Sutras, Dharma Shastras and various Puranas describe Sankranti periods as especially meritorious times. Notably, texts such as theNarada Purana, Matsya Purana, Skanda PuranaandVishnu Dharmasutrastate that religious acts performed during the Sankranti period yield a thousand times more merit compared to those performed at other times. Simha Sankranti is particularly significant for ancestral rituals. Any Shraddha, Tarpan, or Pind Daan performed during this time is believed to deeply satisfy the ancestors and bring prosperity to the lineage.\n\nOn this day, one should bathe early in the morning using water mixed with Ganga water and offer Arghya to the Lord Surya. After that, Tarpan should be performed for ancestors using sesame seeds and water, then offer food with Dakshina to a Brahmin. As per scriptures, anyone who donates food, clothing, umbrellas, footwear, cows, gold or land, etc., during Sankranti with devotion and within their means, earns merit for seven lifetimes.\n\nSimha Sankranti represents the inner strength and radiance of Lord Surya. As the Lord Surya enters its own sign Simha, it becomes a symbol of spiritual energy, penance, wisdom, brilliance, and courage. Therefore, this period is especially beneficial for spiritual seekers. Various Upanishads and Yogic texts mention that Surya worship, Gayatri Mantrachanting and Pranayama performed during Sankranti lead to spiritual accomplishment.\n\nThus, Simha Sankranti is not merely an astronomical event but a significant religious festival. Those who observe fasts, do chanting, take holy baths, offer Tarpan and engage in charity on this day with devotion are blessed both materially and spiritually."

It is also one of the popular days to perform Ganesha Visarjan.\n\nGanesha devotees, who do Visarjan on the next day of Ganesha Chaturthi, perform Ganesha Puja during afternoon and take the Ganapati idols for Visarjan after Madhyahna which is equivalent to midday as per Hindu division of the day.\n\nAs the installation of Ganesha idol was done on previous day during Madhyahna and is taken out for Visarjan on the next day during second half of the day, this type of Visarjan is known as one and half day Ganesha Visarjan.\n\nAlthough the day ofAnant Chaturdashiis the most significant day to perform Ganesha Visarjan, many families do it on the 3rd or 5th or 7th day from the day of Ganesha Chaturthi. It is important to note that all these days are in odd numbers.

Ganesha Visarjan is also known asVinayaka Nimajjanamin Telugu speaking regions.\n\nOn the eleventh day the statue ofLord Ganeshais immersed into water body, preferably in a river, lake or the sea. After the final offering of coconuts, flowers and sweets, the statues of Lord Ganesha are taken to the water body through the street procession with much fanfare. Thousands of devotees join the procession and fill the whole atmosphere with chanting of Lord Ganesha. \"Ganapati Bappa Morya\" and \"Ganesh Maharaj Ki, Jai\" are few of the famous slogans which are chanted throughout the procession.\n\nIn Mumbai, Ganesha Visarjan is performed under the guidance of Ganpati Mandals. The street procession is accompanied with Dhol, Tasha and the other traditional instruments. Ganesha Visarjan continues throughout the night till the next morning.\n\nFew families perform Ganesha Visarjan on the 3rd, 5th or 7th day rather performing it on the 11th day as per their family tradition. The idol of Lord Ganesha can be immersed in the water of tub or bucket."

      "description": "Sharad Purnima is one of the most famous Purnima(s) inHindu Calendar. It is believed that Sharad Purnima is the only day in the year when the moon comes out with all sixteen Kala(s). In Hinduism, each human quality is associated with certain Kala and it is believed that the combination of sixteen different Kala(s) creates a perfect human personality. It wasLord Krishnawho was born with all sixteen Kala(s) and He was the complete incarnation of Lord Vishnu. Lord Ramawas born with only twelve Kala(s).\n\nHence, worshipping God Chandra on the day of Sharad Purnima is considered very significant. Newly wed women, who take pledge to doPurnimasi fastingfor the year, begin the fast from the day of Sharad Purnima. In Gujarat Sharad Purnima is more popularly known asSharad Poonam.\n\nOn this day not only Moon shines with all sixteen Kala(s) but also its rays have certain healing properties which nourish the body and the soul. It is also believed that the moon rays on the day of Sharad Purnima drip nectar. Hence to take advantage of this divine phenomenon, traditionally on the day of Sharad Purnima, Rice-Kheer a famous Indian sweet dish made of cow milk, rice and sugar, is prepared and left in moonlight for the whole night. In the morning, Rice-Kheer which is believed to be invigorated and fortified with the moonlight is consumed and distributed as Prasad in family members.\n\nIn Brij region, Sharad Purnima is also known asRaas Purnima(रास पूर्णिमा). It is believed that on the day of Sharad Purnima Lord Krishna performed Maha-Raas, the dance of divine love. On the night of Sharad Purnima, upon hearing the divine music of Krishna's flute, Gopis of Vrindavan sneaked away from their homes and families to the forest to dance with Krishna throughout the night. It was the day when Lord Krishna created several of Krishna(s) to accompany each Gopi. It is believed that Lord Krishna supernaturally stretched the night to the length of one night of Lord Brahma which was equivalent of billions of human years.\n\nIn many regions Sharad Purnima is known asKojagara Purnimawhen Kojagara Vrat is observed for the whole day. Kojagara Vrat is also known asKaumudi Vrat(कौमुदी व्रत)."

Depending on people and the region, the full moon day in Hindu calendar is also referred as Poornima, Poonam, Pournami and Pournimasi. In Vaishnava tradition Kartik month is known as Damodara month. Damodara is one of the names ofLord Krishna.\n\nIn Hindu calendar, Kartik is the holiest month among all lunar months. Many people take pledge to take holy dip before sunrise in Ganges and other holy rivers every day during the month of Kartik. The ritual of holy dip during Kartik month begins on the day ofSharad Purnimaand ends on Kartik Purnima.\n\nKartik Purnima is also very significant as many rituals and festivals culminate on the day of Kartik Purnima. The festivities of Kartika Purnima begin on the day ofPrabodhini Ekadashi. Ekadashi is the eleventh day and Purnima is the fifteenth day of Kartika month during Shukla Paksha. Hence Kartik Purnima festivities last for five days.\n\nTulasi-Vivah Utsavwhich begins on the day of Prabodhini Ekadashi culminates on the day of Kartik Purnima. As per religious books, Tulasi Vivahcan be performed on any suitable day between Ekadashi to Purnima in the month of Kartik. However, many people choose the day of Kartik Purnima to perform marriage rituals ofGoddess TulasiandLord Shaligram, an iconic representation of Lord Vishnu.\n\nBhishma Panchakafasting which begins on Ekadashi day ends on the day of Kartik Purnima. In Vaishnava tradition, the utmost importance is given to Bhishma Panchaka fasting during the last five days of Kartik month. The five days fasting is known as Bhishma Panchaka as well asVishnu Panchaka.\n\nVaikuntha Chaturdashifasting and Puja is performed on Chaturdashi Tithi i. E. One day before Kartik Purnima. It is believed that Lord Vishnu worshipped Lord Shiva on the day of Kartik Chaturdashi during Shukla Paksha and offered Him one thousand lotus flowers. Many Shiva temples organize special Puja during which Lord Vishnu is worshipped along with Lord Shiva. On the day of Vaikuntha Chaturdashi, a holy dip in Ganges before Sunrise at Manikarnika Ghat in Varanasi is considered very significant among devotees of Lord Shiva.\n\nDev Diwaliwhich is also known as Diwali of Gods is celebrated on the day of Kartik Purnima. It is believed thatLord Shivakilled demonTripurasuraon the day of Kartik Purnima. Hence Kartik Purnima is also known as Tripuri Purnima andTripurari Purnima. As per legends of Tripuri Purnima, Tripurasura defeated Gods and started ruling their kingdom. When Tripurasura was killed, Gods were overjoyed and celebrated the day of Kartik Purnima as the day of illuminations. Hence thousands of earthen lamps are lit at all temples as well as at the bank of river Ganga on the day of Kartik Purnima."

All Ekadashi fasting are dedicated toGoddess Ekadashiwho is one of the Shaktis of Lord Vishnu. Ekadashi was born out of Lord Vishnu to annihilate Demon Mur who intended to kill sleeping Lord Vishnu. Hence Goddess Ekadashi is one of the protective powers of Lord Vishnu.

The Purnima Tithi of Jyeshtha month is also known asVat Purnima. In many regions of India, married women observe a fast on Vat Purnima for the long life of their husbands. Besides this, the day is also considered very auspicious for offering Tarpan and Dana, i. E., donations in memory of ancestors. The day also holds special importance for worshippingLord VishnuandGoddess Lakshmi.\n\nJust like the Vat Savitri Vrat, women can observe a fast on the full moon day for good fortune and the growth of the family. Married women should take a vow for the fast, get fully adorned, and worship theVata Vriksha, i. E., banyan tree. They should offer flowers and sweet water at the root of the Vata Vriksha and tie a raw cotton thread around it while doing Parikrama. After the ritual, they should seek blessings from the elders in the family. The adornment items used for the ritual should be given to an elderly married woman. People who follow the general Purnima fast can also worship Lord Vishnu and Goddess Lakshmi under the Vat tree and chant Mantras.\n\nThis is a special type of fast, and following it properly is believed to fulfill all desires. It is described in theSkanda Purana. When the Jyeshtha Purnima falls on aTuesday, this fast is started. On that day, take a bath in the morning using mustard-mixed water, and worship theBilva Vriksha, i. E., Bael tree with Gandha and Pushpa etc. Eat only once during the day. If the food is seen by a dog, pig, or donkey, it should be discarded immediately. In this way, observe a fast on all full moon days for the next one year.

This day is known asBahuda (बहुदा) YatraorReturn Yatraand is observed on the eighth day after Ratha Yatra on Dashami Tithi (if we do not have any skipped or leaped Tithi during Lords' stay in Gundicha temple).

Lord Jagannatha is worshipped along with his brotherBalabhadraand his sister DeviSubhadra.\n\nRatha Yatra commemorates Lord Jagannatha's annual visit toGundicha (गुंडीचा) Mata temple. It is said that to honor the devotion ofQueen Gundicha, wife of the legendaryKing Indradyumna (इन्द्रद्युम्न)who built the Puri Jagannatha temple, the Lord Jagannatha, Balabhadra and Subhadra leave their regular abode in the main temple and spend a few days in this temple built by Gundicha in their honor.\n\nOne day before of Ratha Yatra, Gundicha Temple is cleaned by devotees of Lord Jagannatha.

This day is known asBahuda (बहुदा) YatraorReturn Yatraand is observed on the eighth day after Ratha Yatra on Dashami Tithi (if we do not have any skipped or leaped Tithi during Lords' stay in Gundicha temple).

Ratha Yatra is also known asPuri Car Festivalamong foreign visitors.\n\nIt should be noted that rituals of Ratha Yatra start much ahead of Ratha Yatra day. Approximately 18 days before of Ratha Yatra Lord Jagannatha, his brother Balabhadra and his sister Devi Subhadra are given famous ceremonial bath which is known asSnana Yatra.

This astronomical event occurs annually at the end of the month of Shravana or the beginning of Bhadrapada. The literal meaning of the word Sankranti is \"transition\" or \"change of position\". In some regions, Simha Sankranti is also referred to asSinghudi SankrantiorSinghada Parva. The period during which the Surya moves from one Rashi to another is called Sankranti. Simha Sankranti marks the occasion of the Surya entering the Simha Rashi and is considered highly auspicious for religious activities such as performing rituals, charity, penance, holy bathing and offerings Pitru Tarpan.\n\nAccording to Vedic astrology, the ruler of Simha Rashi is the Lord Surya. Hence, when the Surya enters Simha Rashi, it is said to be in its own house, i. E., Swagruhi, which amplifies its brilliance, influence and auspiciousness. For this reason, Simha Sankranti is considered a special time for Pitru Aradhana, performing charitable deeds, conducting Shraddha rituals, and offering prayers to the Lord Surya.\n\nGrihya Sutras, Dharma Shastras and various Puranas describe Sankranti periods as especially meritorious times. Notably, texts such as theNarada Purana, Matsya Purana, Skanda PuranaandVishnu Dharmasutrastate that religious acts performed during the Sankranti period yield a thousand times more merit compared to those performed at other times. Simha Sankranti is particularly significant for ancestral rituals. Any Shraddha, Tarpan, or Pind Daan performed during this time is believed to deeply satisfy the ancestors and bring prosperity to the lineage.\n\nOn this day, one should bathe early in the morning using water mixed with Ganga water and offer Arghya to the Lord Surya. After that, Tarpan should be performed for ancestors using sesame seeds and water, then offer food with Dakshina to a Brahmin. As per scriptures, anyone who donates food, clothing, umbrellas, footwear, cows, gold or land, etc., during Sankranti with devotion and within their means, earns merit for seven lifetimes.\n\nSimha Sankranti represents the inner strength and radiance of Lord Surya. As the Lord Surya enters its own sign Simha, it becomes a symbol of spiritual energy, penance, wisdom, brilliance, and courage. Therefore, this period is especially beneficial for spiritual seekers. Various Upanishads and Yogic texts mention that Surya worship, Gayatri Mantrachanting and Pranayama performed during Sankranti lead to spiritual accomplishment.\n\nThus, Simha Sankranti is not merely an astronomical event but a significant religious festival. Those who observe fasts, do chanting, take holy baths, offer Tarpan and engage in charity on this day with devotion are blessed both materially and spiritually."

It is important to note that all these days are in odd numbers.

Ganesha Visarjan is also known asVinayaka Nimajjanamin Telugu speaking regions.\n\nOn the eleventh day the statue ofLord Ganeshais immersed into water body, preferably in a river, lake or the sea. After the final offering of coconuts, flowers and sweets, the statues of Lord Ganesha are taken to the water body through the street procession with much fanfare. Thousands of devotees join the procession and fill the whole atmosphere with chanting of Lord Ganesha. \"Ganapati Bappa Morya\" and \"Ganesh Maharaj Ki, Jai\" are few of the famous slogans which are chanted throughout the procession.\n\nIn Mumbai, Ganesha Visarjan is performed under the guidance of Ganpati Mandals. The street procession is accompanied with Dhol, Tasha and the other traditional instruments. Ganesha Visarjan continues throughout the night till the next morning.\n\nFew families perform Ganesha Visarjan on the 3rd, 5th or 7th day rather performing it on the 11th day as per their family tradition. The idol of Lord Ganesha can be immersed in the water of tub or bucket."

The fasting of Karwa Chauth and its rituals are observed by married women for the long life of their husband. Married women worshipLord Shivaand His family including Lord Ganesha and break the fast only after sighting and making the offerings to the moon. The fasting of Karwa Chauth is strict and observed without taking any food or even a drop of water after sunrise till the sighting of the moon in the night.\n\nKarwa Chauth day is also known asKarak Chaturthi (करक चतुर्थी). Karwa or Karak refers to the earthen pot through which water offering, known asArgha (अर्घ), is made to the moon. Karwa is very significant during Puja and it is also given as Dan to the Brahmin or any eligible woman.\n\nCompare to South Indian states, Karwa Chauth is more popular in North Indian states. After four days of Karwa Chauth, Ahoi AshtamiVrat is observed for the wellbeing of sons. In Maharashtra and other regions, the fast ofVakratunda Sankashti Chaturthiis observed on the day of Karwa Chauth. In this fast, theVakratundaform of Lord Ganesha is worshipped, who is the first among theAshta Vinayakaforms."

The ritual of holy dip during Kartik month begins on the day ofSharad Purnimaand ends on Kartik Purnima.\n\nKartik Purnima is also very significant as many rituals and festivals culminate on the day of Kartik Purnima. The festivities of Kartika Purnima begin on the day ofPrabodhini Ekadashi. Ekadashi is the eleventh day and Purnima is the fifteenth day of Kartika month during Shukla Paksha. Hence Kartik Purnima festivities last for five days.\n\nTulasi-Vivah Utsavwhich begins on the day of Prabodhini Ekadashi culminates on the day of Kartik Purnima. As per religious books, Tulasi Vivahcan be performed on any suitable day between Ekadashi to Purnima in the month of Kartik.

In Vaishnava tradition, the utmost importance is given to Bhishma Panchaka fasting during the last five days of Kartik month. The five days fasting is known as Bhishma Panchaka as well asVishnu Panchaka.\n\nVaikuntha Chaturdashifasting and Puja is performed on Chaturdashi Tithi i. E. One day before Kartik Purnima. It is believed that Lord Vishnu worshipped Lord Shiva on the day of Kartik Chaturdashi during Shukla Paksha and offered Him one thousand lotus flowers. Many Shiva temples organize special Puja during which Lord Vishnu is worshipped along with Lord Shiva. On the day of Vaikuntha Chaturdashi, a holy dip in Ganges before Sunrise at Manikarnika Ghat in Varanasi is considered very significant among devotees of Lord Shiva.\n\nDev Diwaliwhich is also known as Diwali of Gods is celebrated on the day of Kartik Purnima. It is believed thatLord Shivakilled demonTripurasuraon the day of Kartik Purnima. Hence Kartik Purnima is also known as Tripuri Purnima andTripurari Purnima. As per legends of Tripuri Purnima, Tripurasura defeated Gods and started ruling their kingdom. When Tripurasura was killed, Gods were overjoyed and celebrated the day of Kartik Purnima as the day of illuminations. Hence thousands of earthen lamps are lit at all temples as well as at the bank of river Ganga on the day of Kartik Purnima."

Therefore, this month is considered especially important for the eldest child in the family. On the Purnima Tithi of this month, the Chandra travels through the Jyeshtha Nakshatra. The Purnima Tithi of Jyeshtha month is also known asVat Purnima. In many regions of India, married women observe a fast on Vat Purnima for the long life of their husbands. Besides this, the day is also considered very auspicious for offering Tarpan and Dana, i. E., donations in memory of ancestors. The day also holds special importance for worshippingLord VishnuandGoddess Lakshmi.\n\nJust like the Vat Savitri Vrat, women can observe a fast on the full moon day for good fortune and the growth of the family. Married women should take a vow for the fast, get fully adorned, and worship theVata Vriksha, i. E., banyan tree. They should offer flowers and sweet water at the root of the Vata Vriksha and tie a raw cotton thread around it while doing Parikrama. After the ritual, they should seek blessings from the elders in the family. The adornment items used for the ritual should be given to an elderly married woman. People who follow the general Purnima fast can also worship Lord Vishnu and Goddess Lakshmi under the Vat tree and chant Mantras.\n\nThis is a special type of fast, and following it properly is believed to fulfill all desires. It is described in theSkanda Purana. When the Jyeshtha Purnima falls on aTuesday, this fast is started. On that day, take a bath in the morning using mustard-mixed water, and worship theBilva Vriksha, i. E., Bael tree with Gandha and Pushpa etc. Eat only once during the day. If the food is seen by a dog, pig, or donkey, it should be discarded immediately. In this way, observe a fast on all full moon days for the next one year. On the final day of the fast, go near the Bilva tree and fill a container with aprroximatley 1 kg of grains such as barley, wheat, rice, and sesame. Cover another container with two pieces of cloth and install a gold idol ofUma-Maheshwarain it.

Lord Jagannatha is worshipped along with his brotherBalabhadraand his sister DeviSubhadra.\n\nRatha Yatra commemorates Lord Jagannatha's annual visit toGundicha (गुंडीचा) Mata temple. It is said that to honor the devotion ofQueen Gundicha, wife of the legendaryKing Indradyumna (इन्द्रद्युम्न)who built the Puri Jagannatha temple, the Lord Jagannatha, Balabhadra and Subhadra leave their regular abode in the main temple and spend a few days in this temple built by Gundicha in their honor.\n\nOne day before of Ratha Yatra, Gundicha Temple is cleaned by devotees of Lord Jagannatha. The ritual of cleaning Gundicha temple is known asGundicha Marjana (मार्जन)and is held one day before Ratha Yatra.\n\nThe fourth day after Ratha Yatra is celebrated asHera Panchami (हेरा पञ्चमी)whenGoddess Lakshmi, the consort of Lord Jagannatha, visits Gundicha temple in search of Lord Jagannatha.

This day is known asBahuda (बहुदा) YatraorReturn Yatraand is observed on the eighth day after Ratha Yatra on Dashami Tithi (if we do not have any skipped or leaped Tithi during Lords' stay in Gundicha temple). During Bahuda Yatra Lord makes a short stoppage atMausi Maa templewhich is dedicated toGoddess Ardhashini.\n\nIt should be noted that Lord Jagannatha returns to his main abode just beforeDevshayani Ekadashiwhen Lord Jagannatha goes to sleep for four months. Ratha Yatra is also known asPuri Car Festivalamong foreign visitors.\n\nIt should be noted that rituals of Ratha Yatra start much ahead of Ratha Yatra day. Approximately 18 days before of Ratha Yatra Lord Jagannatha, his brother Balabhadra and his sister Devi Subhadra are given famous ceremonial bath which is known asSnana Yatra. Snana Yatra day is observed on Purnima Tithi in Jyeshtha month which is popularly known asJyestha Purnima."

When such information is easily available one should avoid tying Rakhi during Bhadra.\n\nSome sources advise to avoid Bhadra Mukha and perform Rakhi ceremony during Bhadra Punchha if it has to be done during Bhadra in early morning. However our team was not able to find any authority to validate this belief.\n\nTo avoid doing Rakhi ceremony at an inauspicious time it is advisable to check some Panchang like DrikPanchang. Com to find the right time to perform it. We list all Shubh timings which are available to tie Rakhi for most cities across the globe."
